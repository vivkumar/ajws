<h1 class="documentFirstHeading">Non-null types for Java</h1>
<p>Non-null types is a type-based approach to detect possible null pointer
  violations in code statically at compile time. Fähndrich and Leino showed how
  an object-oriented language such as Java or C# could be extended with non-null
  types. We have extended JastAddJ Java compiler, in a modular way, to include non-null
  types. This is an example of how a large JastAdd project can be extended in an
  easy and declarative way. We have also implemented an inference algorithm to
retrofit legacy code to include non-null types.</p>
<p>We provide two tools to support development in Java with non-null types: <em>NonNullChecker</em>, a checker to detect possible null-pointer violations at compile time, and <em>NonNullInference</em>, an inferencer to automatically annotate legacy code with nullness annotations.</p>
<!--<p>The latest distribution of the tools is available at <a class="external-link" href="http://builds.jastadd.org/NonNullTools/latest">
http://builds.jastadd.org/NonNullTools/latest</a> and older versions are available at <a class="external-link" href="http://builds.jastadd.org/NonNullTools">http://builds.jastadd.org/NonNullTools</a>&nbsp;</p>-->
<h3>NonNullChecker</h3>

<p>The non-null checker relies on type annotations to detect possible null-pointer violations. Consider the code snippet below:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>class C {
&nbsp;   void test() { }
&nbsp;   public static void main(String[] args) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     @NonNull C c1 = new C(); // c1 can only hold non-null values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     C c2 = null; // c2 can hold possibly-null values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     c1.test(); // ok: c1 can not be null
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     c2.test(); // error: c2 may be null and the invocation may 
                   //        throw a null pointer exception
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     c1 = c2; // error: a non-null variable may not be assigned a 
                 //        possibly null value

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     c2 = c1; // ok: a possibly-null variable may be assigned a 
                 //     non-null value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     if(c2 != null) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       c1 = c2; // ok: an explicit comparison to null acts as a
                     //     safe cast as long as there are no possibly
                     //     null assignments in the block
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     }
&nbsp;   }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If we run the above program through the non-null checker we get the following output:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt; java -jar JavaNonNullChecker.jar C.java
Errors:
C.java:7:
  Semantic Error: qualifier c2 may be null
C.java:9:
  Semantic Error: can not assign c1 of type C- a value of type C
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The same program can be compiled using a normal Java compiler, but then the possible null-pointer violations would not be detected.</p>

<h3>NonNullInference</h3>
<p>We also provide a non-null inferencer that takes a Java program without nullness annotations and infers some annotations. The annotated code can then be further annotated manually to improve the detection of possible null-pointer violations. The inferencer takes existing annotations into account, so it can be run on partially annotated code to automatically infer more annotations. Consider the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt; cat C.java
class C {
    void v() { }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C c1 = new C();
        C c2 = null;
        c2 = c1;
        c1.v();
        c2.v();
        if(c2 != null) {
            c1 = c2;
        }
    }
}
&gt; java -jar JavaNonNullInferencer.jar -test C.java
class C {
    void v() { }
    public static void main(@NonNull String[] args) {
        @NonNull C c1 = new C();
        C c2 = null;
        c2 = c1;
        c1.v();
        c2.v();
        if(c2 != null) {
            c1 = c2;
        }
    }
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The tool detects that the local variable <em>c1</em> will never hold a null value and therefore annotates it with <em>@NonNull</em>. We think it is desirable to have as many variables non-null as possible and therefore annotates parameters as being non-null if there are no calls where they are possibly-null. That is the reason why the <em>args</em> parameter in <em>main</em> is annotated with <em>@NonNull</em>. There are still possible-null pointer violations in the program, e.g., the invocation of <em>v()</em> on <em>c2</em>. Such errors will be detected if we run the annotated source file through the checker as described previously.</p>
<p>The analysis is a whole program analysis so the tool should preferably process a complete project at a time rather than individual source files. The<em> '-test' </em>option instructs the tool to emit the annotated source code to standard output. Otherwise, the tool will generate annotated source files in a folder named <em>'inferred'</em>. The name of the target folder can be changed using the option <em>'-d'</em>. Further details on command line options are available using <em>-help</em> option.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The inferencer does not infer non-nullness for array elements but only for the array itself. <em>@NonNull String[]</em> is thus a non-null reference to an array where the elements are possibly-null, and this is supported by the current tools. <em>String[@NonNull] </em>is a possibly-null reference to an array where each 
element is <br>non-null which is <em>not</em> supported by the current tools.
<br>
<br>The inferencer wants to infer as many non-null valued references as 
possible.
If a method is not called it will therefore constrain the parameter 
types to be
non-null. This is why we need to do a whole-program analysis when inferring annotations. If we process a project class by class most method 
arguments would
be non-null which would cause a lot of errors when later checking another 
class that uses that class.<br></p>
<p>There may still be possible null-pointer violations in the automatically annotated code. Consider the following example. The analysis can not determine the value 
of <em>b</em> and the reference <em>o</em> must therefore be possibly null. There is thus no way of
preventing the possible null-pointer dereference when calling <em>toString()</em> on <em>o</em>.
If we run the checker on the annotated code we should thus get an error 
that we
are trying to dereference a possibly null valued reference. Such errors 
can not
completely be eliminated unless the analysis is exact, in which case we 
would
not need anotations at all. The normal usage would be to manually guard such
dereferences by an explicit null check before invoking the method. <br></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>String v(boolean b) {
&nbsp;  Object o = b ? new Object() : null;
&nbsp;  String s = o.toString(); // possible null-pointer dereference
&nbsp;  return s;
}</pre>

<h2>Source code<br></h2>
<p>The tools are built as extensions to JastAddJ, the JastAdd Extensible Java Compiler. See <a href="http://jastadd.org">jastadd.org</a> for information about the  repositories for  JastAddJ and the extensions.</p>
<h3>Check out</h3>
<ul type="none">
  <li>Check out the source code for <em>JastAddJ</em></li>
  <li>Check out the source code for the JastAddJ extension <em>JSR308</em> in a sibling directory</li>
  <li>Check out the source code for the JastAddJ extension <em>NonNullChecker</em> in a sibling directory</li>
  <li>Check out the source code for the JastAddJ extension <em>NonNullInference</em> in a sibling directory</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Build</strong></p>
<p>There are separate ant targets for building the tools, running tests, generating runnable jars, and source jars. E.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt; cd NonNullInference
&gt; ant 
&gt; ant test

&gt; ant jar
&gt; ant source
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Tests<br>
</h3>
<ul type="none"><li>There is an ant target named <em>test</em> which executes a test suite for each tool<br></li><li><em>RunTests.java</em> is a test harness which collects and executes all test cases found in the test folder.</li><li>Each test is simply a <em>.java</em> file and a corresponding <em>.result</em> file holding the expected result. 
  </ul>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p>The build file build.xml builds each tool for Java 5, and including the JSR308 extension. Two additional build scripts support the following variants:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>build5.xml</em>, for building the tool for Java 5, but excluding the JSR308 extension.</li>
  <li><em>build1.4.xml</em>, for building the tool for  Java 1.4 only, and  excluding the JSR308 extension.</li>
</ul>
