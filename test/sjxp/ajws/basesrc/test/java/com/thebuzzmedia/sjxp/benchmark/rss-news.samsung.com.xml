				<![CDATA[
					<b>LAS VEGAS, NV, January 5, 2011</b> – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, today announced the launch of its first sliding tablet PC at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Equipped with Microsoft Windows 7 operating system and powered by the upcoming Intel® Atom™ processor platform, currently code-named “Oak Trail,” the PC 7 Series maximizes the benefits of a tablet PC with its compact, light design, and incorporates a sliding keyboard for easy typing, enhanced productivity and performance. The display elegantly slides up to reveal a physical keyboard giving the user the option of a multi-touch display or full keyboard and mouse interface.<br /><br />“With the proliferation of tablet devices, there is a demand from consumers that want the elegance, ease-of-use and portable form factor of a tablet but also the familiarity of a notebook,” said Scott Ledterman, director of mobile PC product marketing at Samsung Enterprise Business Division.  “At first glance, the Samsung PC 7 Series is a compact, light-weight tablet featuring an intuitive touchscreen.  However, once the display is slid into place, it reveals a physical keyboard that offers users the familiar keyboard/touchpad interface.  The Samsung 7 Series is creating a category unto itself, with a total solution that is not only chic and convenient for content consumption, but also versatile enough for more intensive computing and content creation.”<br /><br />“The Samsung Sliding PC 7 Series is a great example of the deep collaboration between Microsoft and Samsung, from engineering to marketing,” said Steve Guggenheimer, corporate vice president of the OEM Division, Microsoft Corporation. “This joint innovation delivers a unique PC design and rich mobile computing experiences for our mutual customers.”<br /><br />“Innovative designs based on Intel Atom processors offer not only improved performance and sleeker devices, but also new, creative form factors,” said Doug Davis, vice president and general manager of the Netbook and Tablet Group at Intel. “The Samsung Sliding PC 7 Series demonstrates how state-of-the-art form factors can help consumers stay connected, while also providing rich, immersive PC-like experiences on the go.”<br /><br /><b>Pioneering Design </b><br />Weighing just 2.2 pounds, the Samsung Sliding PC 7 Series is easily packed into a briefcase and can be used for making presentations or for recording data on the fly.  The 7 Series is suited for both indoor and outdoor use with 340-nit brightness 10.1-inch display supported by an enhanced HD resolution (1366 x 768). With its slim and light weight design, the 7 Series allows for mobility without compromising functionality in personal or professional settings.<br /><br />Everyone from students to mobile professionals can enjoy the convenience of Samsung’s Sliding PC 7 Series. The form factor is ideal for personal computing activities like watching movies or social networking, and can quickly adapt the needs of professional users presenting to clients or taking notes at a meeting.  The device is also perfect for students, thanks to its handy, portable nature and focus on content.  For those who prefer physical keyboards over a touch screen for quickly typing up notes or browsing the Web, the 7 Series features a full, 80/81-key keyboard sleekly tucked away under the display. At the user’s convenience, the keyboard slides out completely, creating a laptop-like interface coupled with the touch capabilities on the display. <br /><br />The six-cell lithium-polymer battery and innovative Eco Light Sensor, which conserves energy and adjusts screen brightness based on available ambient light, allows the 7 Series to last for up to 9 hours. <br /><br /><b>Innovative Mobile Computing</b><br />The ultra-light Samsung Sliding PC 7 Series is engineered with convenience and responsiveness in mind.  Available in either 32GB or 64GB models, the 7 Series features expandable storage with the 4-in-1 memory card reader. The solid-state hard drive and Samsung’s Fast Start feature powers the 7 Series in as little as 15 seconds, or restores from Hibernate and Sleep modes in a mere 3 seconds.  The SSD also fully supports multi-tasking not only in the Windows® mode, but also in touch mode, so users never have to slow down.   <br /><br />Equipped with Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium, the Samsung 7 Series provides familiarity and comfort to users while enhancing their overall experience. Users with entertainment in mind will benefit from high-resolution graphics and an HDMI port for sharing content on an HDTV.  Additionally, the built-in webcam and audio speaker make the 7 Series ideal for video communication with family, friends and coworkers across the globe.<br /><br />Optional 3G connectivity takes the 7 Series to new levels, with Internet connectivity anywhere, anytime.  Moreover, the built-in accelerometer enables portrait or landscape viewing, making the 7 Series perfect for reading daily news articles, or sharing photos with family and friends.<br /><br /><b>Application Ecosystem</b><br />The Sliding PC 7 Series comes with several pre-loaded applications that are optimized for the touch screen display. This includes Samsung’s applications for music, video, photos, note taking, weather, clock, compass and many more. In addition, Microsoft Bing™ Maps provides powerful tools that help get more out of search, including the intuitive Bing voice search, which enables users to type with their voice to find what they’re looking for.

					<b>LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2011</b>—Today at the International Consumer Electronics Show, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Adobe announced that Samsung’s Smart TV platform will be the first to integrate support for Adobe® AIR® 2.5 for TV, making it easy for developers to build, distribute and monetize standalone applications through Samsung’s Smart TV applications store, Samsung Apps. The integration of AIR for TV with Samsung’s Smart TV platform will create new opportunities for a growing community of more than three million Adobe Flash® Platform developers who can use Adobe Creative Suite 5 to author content for AIR for TV. All of Samsung’s 2011 Smart TVs and Smart Blu-ray players will include support for Adobe AIR for TV. <br /><br />Samsung also announced plans to bring Adobe Flash Player 10.1 to its Smart TV browser, extending the company’s current support for Flash Player 10.1 on Samsung smartphones and tablets. With the addition of Flash Player 10.1, users will enjoy a more complete web browsing experience on the TV, with access to millions of websites with rich videos, games and other multimedia content. <br /><br />“Adobe is a key partner for Samsung and we are thrilled to be the first TV manufacturer to support Adobe AIR across the Samsung Smart TV platform,” said<b> Boo-Keun Yoon, President of Samsung’s Visual Display Business.</b> “Together, Samsung and Adobe are transforming the ways in which consumers interact with devices and content, providing rich, interactive applications built with industry-leading, cross platform tools.”<br /><br />“Content publishers want to extend their reach from smartphones to the largest screen in the home – all without sacrificing the unique context and experience of each screen,” said <b>Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO of Adobe</b>.  “Samsung is the first device manufacturer to embrace Adobe AIR for TV, and together we will enable developers to extend media applications, social games and other forms of rich content to televisions and a wide range of Samsung devices.” <br /><br />With Samsung’s Smart TV platform and Adobe AIR for TV, developers are able to leverage existing code to create and deliver standalone applications across devices and platforms. The Samsung Smart TV platform was built with the developer in mind, enabling content creators to develop applications on an open platform, using common web standards like Javascript and XML and now support for Adobe AIR.  The platform uses a single Software Developer Kit (SDK) for Apps that runs across HDTVs, Blu-ray players and Blu-ray Home Theater systems so developers can write once and deploy apps across several platforms. This gives developers the opportunity for more versatile monetization and enables a consistent and intuitive experience for consumers.<br /><br />More information about Samsung’s Smart TV strategy and Samsung’s new partnerships was announced during Mr. Boo-Keun Yoon’s keynote address, which can now be viewed at www.samsungces2011.com.

					<b>LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2011</b>—Today at the International Consumer Electronics (CES) Show, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK) jointly announced the companies’ partnership to continue to revolutionize the way consumers access content and watch TV.  For the first time on a connected TV, the new Xfinity TV service will offer a rich, Web-like interface, enabling simpler navigation and the ability to seamlessly search across linear TV, DVR recordings, and video on demand among tens of thousands of content choices.  A sleek graphics-rich display will guide the viewer to their favorite programming. <br /><br />The partnership also will deliver a customized and integrated multi-platform viewing experience on Samsung smart TVs and the Android™-powered Samsung Galaxy Tab.  On the tablet, the Xfinity TV experience is a virtual television guide and a mobile video player all in one.  Xfinity TV digital customers will be able to browse, discover and sort video content, change the channel on a Samsung smart TV in real time, and program DVRs.  In addition, they can watch streaming TV programming and movies directly on the tablet, and access that content across multiple devices.  The service’s roadmap includes the ability to begin watching a favorite movie on the Samsung Galaxy Tab, then pause the movie and resume watching it on a Samsung smart TV from the exact moment it was paused, and vice versa.<br /><br />The Xfinity TV service was unveiled today at the International Consumer Electronics Show by Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian L. Roberts during a keynote speech by Boo-Keun Yoon, president of Samsung’s Visual Display Business, and will also be demonstrated at the Samsung booth in the Central Hall. <br /><br />“As we begin this exciting new decade, Samsung is also launching a new era of TV technologies that will delight and amaze consumers unlike ever before,” said <b>Boo-Keun Yoon, president of Samsung’s Visual Display Business</b>.  “To partner with the renowned Comcast brand enables us to deliver on our promise of giving consumers greater variety, easy access and control of the content they discover and deliver a more immersive and entertaining experience to Comcast customers.”  <br /><br /><b>Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation</b>, said, “Our partnership with an industry leader like Samsung is another important step in Comcast’s plan to totally reinvent how consumers watch television wherever and whenever they want.  We have the technology framework in place to deliver new features to Comcast customers faster than ever, including on connected TVs, tablets and multiple devices, which is core to our strategy and a key facet of the future of television.”  <br /><br />The Xfinity TV experience will be distributed later this year on the Samsung smart TVs and on the application store for the Galaxy products interacting through the Comcast set-top box, giving consumers yet another access point for discovering and connecting to Comcast Xfinity TV services.  Content can be watched through Samsung’s award-winning LED, LCD and PDP TV products that reflect the company’s commitment to delivering consumers high-quality, visually enhanced and connected entertainment experiences in their home.   <br /><br />More information on Samsung’s smart TV strategy and Samsung’s partnership with Comcast were shared during Mr. Boo-Keun Yoon’s keynote address, which can now be viewed at <a href="http://www.samsungces2011.com" target="_blank" style="color:#1922dd">www.samsungces2011.com</a>. <br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.</b><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

				<![CDATA[
					<b>LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2011</b>—Today, at the International Consumer Electronics Show, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., heralded a new era of digital technology, driven by the philosophy that companies must look to human nature to inspire technologies more uniquely fitted to the human experience. <br /><br />Samsung Visual Display President Boo-Keun Yoon dubbed this philosophy “Human Digitalism” in an original keynote event, which was designed to echo the completely immersive entertainment experience Samsung seeks to create through its award-winning 2011 home theater ecosystem lineup. As part of the hour-long performance, Mr. Yoon introduced new TV designs, new 3D TV features, and unique Smart TV partnerships with Adobe, Comcast, DreamWorks Animation, Hulu and Time Warner Cable. <br /><br />“The next step in the evolution of consumer electronics is to place human life at the center of the creative process,” Mr. Yoon said. “For Samsung, this means giving people access to entertainment experiences that complement rather than disrupt the way we live. We aimed to celebrate the curiosity, connection and exuberance of human nature throughout our keynote event.”  <br /><br />President Yoon was joined on stage by a host of performers, including an 11-year-old boy named “Zoll,” who was born in the year 2000 and watched as technology evolved throughout his life. As the voice of 2011, “Zoll” personified a new generation of consumers that increasingly demand access to the content they want, when they want it, and on the screen or device of their choosing. Against a backdrop of stunning LED lighting and dramatic set changes, President Yoon and his guests brought to life four principles—dubbed the “Four As” of Access, Align, Amaze and Act—that will guide Samsung through the coming era of smart TV. <br /><br />The keynote also featured guest appearances by President Yoon; Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts; Time Warner Cable Chairman and CEO Glenn Britt; Hulu CEO Jason Kilar; Adobe President and CEO Shantanu Narayen; and DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg. <br /><br /><b>Access: Simple, Intuitive Access to High-Quality Content</b><br />During the keynote, Yoon described how Samsung’s cloud-based platform is breaking down the walls between devices—such as smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, PCs, camcorders and cameras—and revealed new ways to access entertainment and information services through Samsung’s Internet-enabled products. “Samsung’s role in the smart TV ecosystem is to offer consumers more choice and more control,” Yoon said. “Our networked products and pioneering content partnerships will help us provide these benefits.” <br /><br />Among the announcements were new or expanded partnerships with Comcast and Time Warner Cable to bring streaming video-on-demand (VOD) services to Samsung Smart TV customers via the Samsung Apps storefront. Comcast’s Xfinity TV Application and a new VOD service from Time Warner Cable allow users to browse and view TV listings, VOD content, online video and DVR recordings on a Samsung smart TV or Samsung Galaxy Tab, and to switch from one screen to another without missing a beat. Samsung and Time Warner Cable also announced a partnership to deliver these enhanced content and navigation options across multiple smart TV screens, without the need for an additional set-top box. <br /><br />Also during the Samsung keynote address, Hulu CEO Jason Kilar announced for the first time that Hulu is working to bring the Hulu Plus subscription service to select Android phones (running Android OS 2.2). Hulu provided the audience a sneak peek to the new Hulu Plus Android app, which will give consumers exclusive access to full seasons of popular, current TV shows like Glee, Modern Family, The Office, and House, from ABC, Fox, NBC, and more for only $7.99 per month. Hulu Plus subscribers can already watch shows instantly via Samsung connected TVs and Blu-ray players and, in the coming months, on Android smartphones as well. <br /><br />The partnership with Adobe will open up new opportunities for more than three million Flash developers worldwide and deliver content and applications for entertainment, information services, social networking, gaming and more. Samsung announced that it is the first television manufacturer to support Adobe® AIR® 2.5 for TV, which allows developers to leverage existing code and familiar tools to create and extend applications across Samsung smartphones, tablets and smart TVs. Samsung is also bringing Adobe Flash® Player 10.1 to its smart TV browser, allowing consumers to access millions of sites with rich, Flash based videos, games and other multimedia content. <br /><br />When combined with the most intuitive user interface on the market, these partnerships will create a more seamless entertainment experience across Samsung’s Smart TV ecosystem. More information about Samsung’s partnership announcements is available at the Samsung CES microsite: <a href="http://www.SamsungCES2011.com" target="_blank" style="color:#1922dd">www.SamsungCES2011.com</a>. <br /><br /><b>Align: Products That Blend Seamlessly into Consumers’ Lifestyles</b><br />Yoon introduced a new design concept, called “One Design,” centered on the notion that smart TVs should blend seamlessly into their surroundings and more naturally accommodate consumers’ preferences for interacting with their TVs.<br /><br />“One of the greatest misconceptions people have about smart TV is that it is a PC on a bigger screen,” Yoon said. “But smart TV is still above all a TV, and it needs to give consumers a “lean-back experience” without any hassle and inconvenient keyboards. By letting people easily and comfortably control their smart TVs, Samsung is going to put TV back at the center of consumers’ entertainment experiences.” <br /><br />This concept was brought to life through the introduction of several new design elements, including innovative, super narrow TV bezels on select products in the 2011 TV lineup that give consumers a larger viewing screen without increasing the size of the TV. This new design concept gives consumers a total immersive viewing experience by allowing the bezel to become almost invisible. Additionally, Samsung demonstrated a new, more intuitive smart TV user interface that is accessible through Samsung’s Galaxy line of smartphones. Among other upgrades, the updated UI features an easy-to-use SearchAll function that can find content across live TV, apps, websites and any devices connected through the Samsung AllShare feature, such as a PC, camcorder, tablet or cell phone. <br /><br /><b>Amaze: A New Dimension of Enjoyment Through Completely Immersive Viewing Experiences</b><br />Outlining Samsung’s belief that consumers crave more realistic and immersive viewing experiences, Yoon announced a number of new content options and innovations for 3D TV, including new 3D innovations for Samsung Smart TVs.  <br /><br />Under a newly expanded strategic alliance, Samsung and DreamWorks have agreed to explore ways to collaborate on the research and development of future technologies related to 3D TV and Smart TV. The two companies also plan to explore a new streaming 2D & 3D VOD service that would make DreamWorks Animation content available for download via the Samsung Apps store beginning in 2011. Further, consumers who purchase a new Samsung 3D TV will gain exclusive access to two of DreamWorks Animation’s new 3D Blu-ray titles, including Megamind, which will be made available in 2011.  <br /><br /> Yoon said, “Like Smart TV, content is a key factor for enjoying 3D TV, and we are working hard to secure a wide selection of high-quality 3D content for our customers. By partnering with leading 3D content creators like DreamWorks Animation, we are enabling a complete 3D ecosystem.” <br /><br />Other new elements in the 3D ecosystem include Samsung’s innovative new 3D audio technology, which takes consumers even deeper into the viewing experience by simulating the height and depth of the audio track. 3D Sound uses technology that can distinguish between sounds that are in the foreground and background of a movie or TV show and then creates an immersive, life-like audio experience. Yoon also noted Samsung’s new 3D TVs and 3D Blu-ray disc players, and announced plans to offer devices like 3D cameras and camcorders that let consumers create their own 3D content. Additionally, Samsung introduced new prescription 3D glasses, designed by Silhouette to be lightweight and stylish to better fit consumers’ viewing preferences. On stage, Katzenberg helped Yoon demonstrate how the glasses could charge wirelessly, eliminating yet another cable from consumers’ living rooms. <br /><br /><b>Act: Commitment to a Healthy Planet</b><br />Through its “Planet First” initiative, which has been recognized for substantially reducing energy usage in consumer electronics, Samsung is honoring its commitment to putting human life at the center of everything the company does. Said Yoon, “Samsung is not only developing breakthrough technologies, but also taking care of the planet wherever we can. This is at the heart of human digitalism.” <br /><br />Yoon explained how using Samsung products is an eco-friendly act. For example, Samsung’s 2011 LED TVs use up to 40 percent less energy than LCD TVs. Additionally, Samsung was listed number one among global IT companies for Carbon Disclosure Leadership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and for the past two years has received the Energy Star label from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Most recently, Samsung received the CES Eco-Design and Sustainable Technology Innovation Award.  <br /><br />Yoon also described how Samsung is creating a greener future by actively seeking out greener energy sources like solar power to replace gas and petroleum. By 2020 the company will have invested $23 billion on green initiatives. <br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. </b><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 174,000 people in 193 offices across 66 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

					<b>LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2011</b>—At the International Consumer Electronics Show, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (Nasdaq: DWA) announced that the two leaders of technology and entertainment are joining forces for more immersive entertainment experiences in 2011. <br /><br />DreamWorks Animation CEO <b>Jeffrey Katzenberg</b> joined Samsung Visual Display President <b>Boo-Keun Yoon</b> on-stage Thursday for his keynote speech, during which the two companies described plans for an expanded strategic alliance. Consumers who purchase a new Samsung 3D TV will gain exclusive access to two of DreamWorks Animation’s new 3D Blu-ray titles, including Megamind, which will be made available in 2011. The animation studio and consumer electronics company also intend to explore joint research and development activities and a number of expanded co-marketing initiatives throughout the year.  <br /><br />“As a technology leader, Samsung’s expanded alliance with DreamWorks Animation—recognized across the industry as a 3D entertainment innovator—marks our collective goal to offer consumers the best of technology and entertainment combined,” said Yoon. “Through this mutual relationship, DreamWorks Animation is helping us to create an increasingly immersive home entertainment experience for audiences at a moment’s notice.”  <br /><br />“We have seen firsthand over the last 18 months why Samsung is the consumer electronics industry leader and a pioneer in bringing high-quality 3D experiences into the home in a meaningful way,” added Katzenberg. “We look forward to continuing our valued strategic alliance and furthering our reach in enabling audiences to bring more of their favorite DreamWorks Animation content to life at home.” <br /><br /><b>Expanded Collaboration for R&D and Co-Marketing</b><br />As part of their expanded collaboration efforts, the two companies have agreed to explore ways to work together on research and development of future technologies related to 3D TV and smart TV. In 2010, Samsung introduced the first 3D LED TV, and DreamWorks has been a leading entertainment provider of high-quality 3D films and Blu-ray discs. The two companies hope to combine their talents to improve home entertainment even further than they have today.<br /><br />In 2011, the 3D Blu-ray version of Megamind will become the next DreamWorks Animation title to be made available exclusively to purchasers of new Samsung 3D TVs as part of a bundled promotion. In addition, Samsung and DreamWorks Animation expect to increase their co-marketing and promotional activities in an effort to reach more consumers with their joint offerings.  <br /><br /><b>More Immersive Content for Smart TVs</b><br />The two companies plan to explore a new streaming 3D Video-On-Demand (VOD) service that would make DreamWorks Animation content – trailers and promotions in both 3D and 2D – available for streaming via the 3D application for Samsung Smart TVs beginning in 2011. This represents an innovative new method by which film studios can use smart TV to reach consumers directly. Upon launch, consumers will be able to access VOD content through any of Samsung’s LED, LCD and Plasma 3D smart TVs, all of which deliver high-quality, visually enhanced and connected entertainment experiences to the home.  <br /><br />The new VOD service aligns with Samsung’s goal of establishing a 3D ecosystem that provides a completely immersive and connected viewing experience for consumers. Additionally, the expanded relationship will help DreamWorks Animation to adapt its 3D home offerings to a new era of smart TV, in which viewers are increasingly accustomed to having access to their favorite content at the click of a button.  <br /><br />With the launch of Samsung Apps in 2010, Samsung broadened the connected TV experience, bringing services such as full HD video, casual games, communications, social and location services, and text-based information to consumers. DreamWorks Animation joins more than 30 other industry-leading partners on Samsung Apps, including Blockbuster, Facebook, Netflix, Pandora, Twitter, USA TODAY, and Vudu, in bringing personalized, easy to use connected TV experiences to consumers. <br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. </b><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 174,000 people in 193 offices across 66 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

				<![CDATA[
					<b>LAS VEGAS, January 5, 2011</b> – <b>Samsung Electronics</b> Co. Ltd., today debuted a line of breakthrough TV accessories including:<br /><br />Light-weight prescription-ready 3D active glasses<br />Samsung’s first wireless charger for 3D active glasses<br />A Touch Control that offers remote TV viewing<br />A Skype™-certified high-definition (HD) TV camera that transforms televisions into large screen video phones<br /><br /> Samsung’s 2011 TV accessory line will be showcased at booth #12006 in the Central Hall at the International Consumer Electronics Show, which will be held at the Las Vegas Convention Center, January 6-9, 2011. The line includes four winners of the CES Innovations Design and Engineering Awards.<br /><br />“The TV accessories segment is is currently filled with clunky, “me too” products that provide limited benefits. As the leader in TV manufacturing, we wanted to create complementary TV accessories that are unique, highly-functional and beautifully designed,” said <b>Sangchul Lee, Senior Vice President, Visual Display Business</b> at Samsung Electronics. “From the Touch Control, inspired by Samsung smart phones, to the world’s first prescription-ready 3D active glasses, Samsung’s commitment to technology innovation is crystal clear in the new accessories line.”<br /><br /><b>Feather-Light and Fast 3D Active Glasses that Support Prescription Lenses</b><br /><br />Since the best possible 3D TV experience is one that encourages immersive viewing, Samsung has redesigned its 3D active glasses to offer maximum picture quality, comfort, extended wear and an attractive design. Weighing just under an ounce at 0.06 lbs, the world’s lightest 3D active glasses (model SSG-3700CR) were completely restructured to achieve a 25 percent weight reduction when compared to previous glasses. The <b>SSG-3700CR</b> has a redesigned component layout and uses lighter material, a smaller print circuit board and RF technology for more reliable connections.<br /><br />However, these weight reductions do not compromise performance. Samsung also cut the LCD response time to improve the contrast ratio. The net result is a brighter 3D picture with less cross-talk (ghosting) and viewing fatigue.<br /><br />Viewers who wear eyeglasses can order special prescription lenses that attach to the SSG-3700CR so they can enjoy 3D TV with only one pair of glasses. For those who prefer to wear their own eyeglasses, Samsung has incorporated a new temple design that connects to the top of the LCD frame for a greater range of movement and to minimize the possibility of breaking. The frame and temples are made of a flexible material used in regular eyeglasses so the SSG-3700CR’s temples can stretch and bend to accommodate virtually any size head. The glasses also have an adjustable, removable nose pad and enhanced weight balance thanks to the new placement of the printed circuits and batteries behind each ear.<br /><br />Recharging is simple, either via the included USB cable or optional Samsung wireless charger. Additionally, the SSG-3700CR includes an indicator on the side of the glasses that gauges battery life. The glasses automatically turn on when moved or placed on the face and power off when motion or touch is not detected by the embedded motion and accelerometer sensors.<br /><br /><b>Watch Programs on the 3” LCD Touch Control for Smart TVs</b><br /><br /><b>The Touch Control</b> (model RMC30D1) operates  almost entirely through a touch screen. Not only can users continue to watch TV programs on the remote’s 3-inch LCD screen when they’re out of the room, when paired with select premium Samsung TVs, the Touch Control’s multi display feature lets users continue to watch TV on the screen even while a Blu-ray is being played on the TV. Content playing on the TV from connected components, such as Blu-ray players, DVD products and more can also be watched on the remote.<br /><br />The Touch Control has an advanced processor to support the evolution of television from a passive viewing device to a living room media hub. When connected to a home wireless network, the Touch Control can access Samsung Apps, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, even when the TV is off. A QWERTY keyboard appears on the touch screen when text entry is needed.<br /><br />The RMC30D1 has a stylish glossy black finish with sleek, silver metal trim which was inspired by Samsung’s sophisticated smart phone design. The touch screen offers full control of TV features with only two physical buttons – power and function – thereby eliminating the awkward, cluttered button look on conventional TV remotes.<br /><br /><b>Simple Charging Solution with the Stylish Wireless Charger</b><br /><br />Samsung’s wireless charger (model CY-SWC1000A) charges up to four pairs of 3D active glasses through an elegant, glossy black cylinder that resembles a classic men’s top hat.  An internal LED light will pulse softly to show recharging is in progress.<br /><br />Using electromagnetic induction technology and operating on standard household electricity, the CY- SWC1000A is highly efficient at transferring electric energy to devices on the surface of the charger. The time taken to charge Samsung’s 2011 3D active glasses (models SSG-3700CR, SSG-3300GR, SSG-3300CR) on the wireless charger is similar to a wired charge.<br /><br /><b>Control Home Entertainment Wirelessly</b><br /><br />Samsung is offering two wireless accessories to help make the TV the center of the home network. The new Samsung wireless router (model CY-SWR1100) provides easy-set-up and an optimized solution for Samsung TVs. It includes Samsung’s patented One Foot Connection, which establishes a Wi-Fi connection to Samsung 2011 TVs and other compatible devices. During the initial set-up, users simply need to put the router within one foot of these devices to establish a connection; the router can subsequently be moved to any part of the home while still maintaining this connection.<br /><br />The Samsung Wireless LAN Adapter (model WISO9ABGN) provides access to Internet-based content via Samsung Apps. It also connects Samsung TVs wirelessly to multimedia devices, including Samsung’s Touch Control, PCs, cameras, Blu-ray disc players, mobile phones and more. The WISO9ABGN supports DLNA 1.5 and 802.11 a/b/g/n.<br /><br /><b>Samsung’s TV Camera Brings Videophones to the Big Screen</b><br /><br />Samsung’s TV camera (model CY-STC1100) transforms Samsung TVs into large-screen, living room videophones. Unlike other TV cameras, the Samsung TV camera for Skype addresses the key challenges encountered when making a call in a living room versus at a computer, such as low light and seating distance from the TV, which can diminish video quality and sound. The TV camera, which enables video calls on a Samsung TV without a headset or webcam, features a built-in HD sensor (720p at 30 fps), auto focus to keep the subject in-focus even when shifting positions, four high-fidelity microphones to capture voice at up to 13 feet away with ambient noise, and advanced HD video encoding.<br /><br />Installing the Samsung TV camera is easy. Users simply plug the USB cable into the TV and attach the TV camera to the back of the TV using the camera’s magnets. The CY-STC1100’s slim design, at slightly more than a half an inch thick, helps it blend well with even the thinnest Samsung TVs. A flexible camera neck wraps around the top of the TV, easily allowing the user to adjust the lens position and identify the perfect shooting angle.<br /><br /><b>Additional New TV Accessories and Line Availability</b><br /><br />Samsung is also previewing four categories HDMI cables with basic, swivel and premium connectors as well as three ultra-slim wall mounts for LED and Plasma TVs.<br /><br />The full line of Samsung accessory products will be available in the first half of 2011.<br /><br />CES-specific information may be found at <a href= "www.samsungces2011.com" target="_blank" style="color:#192266">www.samsungces2011.com</a>.

The new smart TVs address consumers’ growing need for greater choice and control over how and when they access content. <br /><br />Samsung will be augmenting its extensive product lines by previewing at CES more than 40 new models with screen sizes from 19-inches to 65-inches. The new TVs offer dramatically enhanced picture quality in 2D, 3D, HD and streaming content, as well as richer connected entertainment options delivered through one of the most comprehensive offering of apps and connected devices.  <br /><br />Samsung’s 2011 line-up combines elegant styling with a wide range of higher-end features previously exclusive to premium sets, including 3D capabilities and improved, advanced smart TV features so that people get the most out of their entertainment experience. Select models will offer Samsung’s new Smart Hub, which includes:<br /><br />·         Search All, which makes it easier to search for desired content on your TV and other DLNA-certified connected media storage devices, networked PC and mobile devices, and Internet and video-on-demand services.<br /><br />·         Your Video, which delivers recommendations based on a user’s viewing history.<br /><br />·         Web Browser, which offers full web browsing right from your TV.<br /><br />·         Samsung Apps, the world’s first HDTV-based application store, which offers a range of paid and free apps that help people connect to their various passions – whether in sports, entertainment, information, games or social networking. <br /><br />Samsung will also expand the number of 3D TV models available in 2011 so more people can enjoy 3D home entertainment at affordable prices. Consumers will be able to choose from a wide range of TVs to suit any home and lifestyle needs. Several TVs sport new innovative, ultra-thin TV bezels that give consumers a larger viewing screen without increasing the size of the TV. The new bezels are the result of extensive design research, Samsung’s proprietary new panel technology and innovative signal processing technology. <br /><br />As the pioneer in 3D home entertainment, Samsung realized that consumers are increasingly choosing larger TV screens to fully experience immersive 3D entertainment, and today also previewed a 75-inch LED TV. <br /><br />The latest TV lineup will be on display at Samsung’s booth #12006 in the Central Hall at the International Consumer Electronics Show, which will be held at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), January 6-9, 2011. The LED D8000 series TV, a CES 2011 Innovations Design and Engineering Award winner, will also be on display in the Grand Lobby at the LVCC. <br /><br />“As we enter a new era of immersive and inclusive entertainment, Samsung has redefined the visual elements that will make our TVs the centerpiece of any room,” said Sangchul Lee, Senior Vice President, Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “People want to stay connected to the relationships and information that are important to them, and our latest line-up reflects a vision where smarter technology virtually and physically connects users through shared moments in the comfort of their homes.”  <br /><br /><b>Deep Focus on Immersive and Smart Entertainment Supported by Breakthrough Engineering and Design</b><br />As the No. 1 brand for TVs in the US and globally, Samsung led the industry in 2010 with the launch of the world’s first 3D TV and today holds over 70 percent of the market share in the US. As 3D content becomes more prevalent, the company expects more consumers to opt for 3D features in their TVs. To this end, it aims to reduce the cost of acquiring a 3D entertainment system – 3D TV, Blu-ray player, 3D glasses and content – in 2011 by more than two-thirds and making 3D features available in a wider range of models.  <br /><br />Samsung also successfully reduced the bezel size by up to 80 percent – an engineering feat – so that the thin bezel blends in easily with the environment, almost becoming invisible to the viewer, and becomes even less of a distraction when watching 3D.  <br /><br />The reduction in bezel size means consumers can enjoy a larger viewing screen and wider viewing angle without having to increase the physical size of their TVs, and makes using social applications like Skype and YouTube, browsing the Web, sharing content and playing games that much more inclusive. <br /><br />Samsung expects 2011 to be a watershed year for connected TV. Almost all of Samsung’s new 40-inch and above 2011 TVs will offer smart TV features, making it even easier for viewers to engage their passions by accessing Web-delivered content on their big digital screens. <br /><br /><b>The Ultimate Entertainment Showpiece with Bespoke Design Features and True-to-Life Picture Quality </b><br />The first thing you notice about the LED D8000 series is its barely visible 0.2” brushed metal bezel, a fine line that subtly frames the rich content on the screen and enhances the TV’s light form factor. The D8000 Series continues the minimalist style of the award-winning C8000 Series and uses an improved Quad Stand to ensure ultimate harmony between the TV and its environment. <br /><br /><center><img src="/us/images/news/LED8000.jpg"></center><br /><br />With a 240Hz refresh rate, 2 millisecond motion picture response time (MPRT) and improved LED backlight scanning, this CES Innovation Award honoree offers true-to-life 2D, 3D and HD images with outstanding clarity. In addition to the Ultra Clear Panel, the TV is the first to offer Micro Dimming Plus technologies to provide the richest, most lifelike pictures with deep blacks and pure whites.  <br /><br />The D8000 Series comes with Samsung’s new 3D glasses and Samsung’s innovative Touch Control that can also stream TV programs to its built-in 3” LCD screen, almost like a second TV, even while a Blu-ray disc is being played on the TV. <br /><br />The D8000 has a built-in Wi-Fi connection and many convenient ways to manage and display content through Samsung’s Smart Hub portal. The set can connect to other devices using DLNA or Samsung's patented One Foot Connection technology. <br /><br /><b>Setting Up Full 3D Becomes a Breeze With the World’s First Auto 3D Format Setup Function </b><br />The Samsung LED D7000 Series represents a successful balance of high technology with minimalist design aesthetics. The stunningly thin 0.2” black bezel is framed by a jewel-like transparent bezel that uses Samsung's award-winning Touch of Color™ (ToC™) dual-injection mold technology to reflect a hint of red along the crystal bezel’s edge.  The Quad Stand is slimmer than the one introduced in 2010, yet its lower height manages to keep the TV stable and sturdy while maintaining an air of elegance.<br /><br /><center><img src="/us/images/news/led2.jpg"></center><br /><br />Watching 3D content has never been easier – with the Auto 3D Format Setup, the TV automatically detects the encoding format (i.e. side-by-side and top-bottom) when playing 3D content and viewers can now sit back and let their smart TV configure the content for the best viewing experience.  <br /><br />The LED D7000 also incorporates improved backlight scanning technology and Auto Motion Plus, Samsung’s proprietary frame interpolation algorithm, to create sharp 2D and 3D pictures and smooth frame transitions without blurring, even for video moving at top speeds; 3D picture quality is also improved as a result of Samsung’s new 3D Peak Algorithm. <br /><br />With Smart Hub, the LED D7000 Series is the ideal media center, complementing consumers’ ever connected and mobile lifestyles.  <br /><br /><b>The Ideal Value Model TV for an Immersive 3D Experience </b><br />For the consumer looking to embrace 3D entertainment without breaking the bank, the Samsung LED D6400 Series TV is the ideal 120Hz 3D LED TV, offering stunningly clear 3D pictures with the world's best panel technology and proprietary image-improving techniques. Samsung’s unique double-rate frame transition technology – the world’s fastest – also reduces the picture frame transition time by 50 percent to enhance the viewing quality of 3D content.<br /><br /><center><img src="/us/images/news/led3.jpg"></center><br /><br />The LED D6400 also offers Samsung’s narrow bezel design to deliver a more immersive 3D viewing experience. The prism-like ToC™ thin bezel has a hint of red that is barely visible from the front, but intensifies as the viewer moves to the side to minimize distractions while watching 3D, 2D, HD or streaming content. <br /><br />Samsung’s 3D Peak Algorithm reduces average power consumption by about 15 percent while increasing peak brightness by 20 percent. Its unique Motion Adaptive Dimming algorithm also reduces power consumption up to 20 percent by controlling LED brightness, according to motion vectors in the picture. In addition, LED 6400 was developed using Samsung’s eco-friendly design technologies and seeks to minimize its environmental footprint during its life-cycle.<br /><br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. </b><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

We’re pleased that the industry has already recognized several of our new products as one of the most innovative at CES.” <br /><br /><b>Cubic Design Packs In a Home Theater Punch</b><br />Bringing the 3D movie experience in theaters home, the innovative Samsung HT-D7100 3D Blu-ray theater system has a unique, modular cubic design. It supports full HD 1080p video playback for both Blu-ray and standard DVDs, and can also up-convert older, non-HD content so that it can be played at full 1080p. The HT-D7100 also has a powerful video processor to convert 2D content to 3D.<br /><br /><center><img src="/us/images/news/htd7100.jpg"></center><br /><br />Honored with a CES Innovations Design and Engineering Award, the HT-D7100 features satellite speakers with a distinctive metallic retro design. Each separate component is small enough to be placed on a bedroom table or bookshelf, making it the ideal system for people who have small living spaces but still want robust sound output (110 watts).   <br /><br />The main receiver has built-in Wi-Fi for wireless access to interactive and web-based content through Smart Blu-ray Home Theater features. It also features AllShare™, which allow people to wirelessly sync digital devices so that they can enjoy music, movies and photos directly from their DLNA-certified PC, camera and mobile devices on their larger TV screen. <br /><br />The HT-D7100 packs in many premium audio formats, including Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.

With Samsung’s improved Crystal Sound Plus technology, the HT-D7100 generates accurate sound reproduction that protects the listener and the equipment from potentially harmful volume peaks and signal distortion that can damage hearing and the speakers. <br /><br /><b>Warm and Natural Sounding 7.1 Channel Home Theater System</b><br />Another CES Innovation and Design Award winner, the Samsung HT-D6730W delivers high-fidelity, robust audio. It packs the full 1080p HD playback of Blu-ray discs and 3D playback features of the HT-D7100 into a powerful 1,300W 7.1 channel home theater system. The wideband amp extends the audible range to 50 kHz, far beyond that of standard home theater amps. When combined with the super tweeter speakers that are included in the set, the user experiences a warmer and more natural audio soundscape in both 2D and 3D. <br /><br />The HT-D6730W supports HD formats including Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby True HD and DTS-HD Master Audio, as well as Samsung’s Crystal Sound Plus and 3D Sound technology. The HT-D6730W is the first home theater system to offer Samsung’s Advanced Vertical Surround sound. The front height speakers have now been incorporated into the tall boy for a cleaner look and can be adjusted to deliver an immersive vertical surround sound experience. <br /><br />The HT-D6730W has built-in Wi-Fi so that it can wirelessly sync devices with AllShare and receive Web-based content via Smart Blu-ray Home Theater as well as firmware updates. It has wireless rear speakers for flexible, cordless placement in the viewing room. Additionally, an Apple-certified iPod/iPhone dock provides seamless access to music, movies and other media stored in iTunes. <br /><br />Designed to complement the full line of Samsung’s stylish HDTVs, the HT-D6730W sports a midnight black, high gloss finish for an elegance that blends with other components in the room. The system consists of six speakers: a wide center channel speaker for clear dialogue, a large but unobtrusive passive radiator subwoofer, two tower super tweeter speakers which include embedded height channel speakers and two surround speakers. The speakers operate without protection grilles, improving sound clarity and giving them a stylishly retro appearance.<br /><br /><b>World’s First Internet-Ready, Integrated Blu-ray 7.1 AV Receiver</b><br />For a true theater experience at home, the Samsung Blu-ray AV Receiver (model HW-D7000) is the world’s first 7.1 channel AV receiver with 3D Blu-ray playback and Internet-based services in one integrated component. The HW-D7000 can also access content via Smart Blu-ray Home Theater features like Samsung Apps and stream movies and music from web-based services such as Netflix and Pandora. It has built-in Wi-Fi and is DLNA-certified to help consumers share content simply between certified devices.  <br /><br />The HW-D7000 has a brushed metallic finish and a high-gloss panel that hides an integrated Blu-ray load-in slot. When the Blu-ray door is opened, the display moves downward, unveiling the load-in slot. The sophisticated touch screen panel lets the user softly press icons on the display to navigate the system. It also comes with a single remote to control the receiver and Blu-ray.  <br /><br />Equipped with a 7.1 channel hi-fi quality amplifier, the HW-D7000 can be matched with any hi-fi loudspeakers on the market. The speaker terminals connect to large speaker cables through binding posts. The AV receiver supports Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio for high quality surround sound. It features the latest surround decoder, Dolby Pro Logic IIz, which creates an extra height channel for an enhanced spatial sound experience.  <br /><br />For 3D entertainment, the HW-D7000 features 3D Sound with 120 watts per channel, delivering powerful, theater-like sound to the room. It features the latest 3D technology so the user can enjoy 3D movies fully with any 3D TV.<br /><br />The HW-D7000 is packed with four HDMI inputs to allow consumers to organize their devices easily with Anynet (HDMI-CEC). The unit also features HDMI 1.4 with 3D video pass and ARC (Audio Return Channel), which enables the user to use one HDMI cable to transfer audio from the TV back to the receiver.<br /><br /><b>Next Generation Sound Bar</b><br />Designed for consumers yearning to upgrade an aging home entertainment configuration with one simple solution, the new Samsung sound bar (model HW-D550) delivers high-quality 3D audio to match 3D HDTV quality. It  also includes Samsung’s 3D Sound technology and syncs with 3D video to create 3D sound sensations that come at the listener without the need for additional satellite speakers.

				<![CDATA[
					<b>CES, Las Vegas – January 5, 2011</b> -Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today announced the launch of the two latest point-and-share camcorders in its 2011 portfolio. The Full <b>HD HMX-P300 and HMX-P100</b> have been designed for those who love sharing videos with friends and family, and enjoy capturing film spontaneously and uploading just as quickly. Stylish, pocket-sized and affordable, the HMX-P300 and HMX-P100 have been created to be carried anywhere, and make uploading and sharing special moments both easy and fun.  <br /><br />The HMX-P300 and HMX-P100 follow the Samsung HMX-E10 model, bringing with them the latest developments in Samsung imaging technology, ultimately comprising some of the best value point-and-share camcorders on the market. Key developments including a 5M BSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS sensor, which dramatically improves low-light recording and HD movie recording, are available in the P100. The HMX-P300 and HMX-P100 are also the ultimate point-and-share camcorders for those who want to upload their videos quickly and easily. Through the new One Touch Sharing feature, users can select which website they want to upload files to directly from the LCD screen. . Both point-and-share camcorders come with advanced Intelli-Studio 2.0 software pre-installed so it’s easy to connect to a PC and start sharing straight away. <br /><br /><center><img src="/us/images/news/HMX-P300.jpg"></center><br /><br />The HMX-P300 is also specially adapted to make video capture easy from any angle, by including a 3x Optical Zoom and Pivot Recording Mode, enabling you to capture greater detail at any occasion, such as concerts or sporting events, in horizontal or vertical frames. The 3x Optical Zoom allows you to record in clear and brilliant detail while on-the-go, without sacrificing video quality. The 3” 230K pixel Touch LCD screen can also rotate to give multiple shooting angles that allow the user a full, clear view of their subject without sacrificing the shot through portrait or landscape orientation. To make sure that you don’t miss any of the action, the Samsung HMX-P100 is also built with an LCD screen that has an 80-degree viewing angle, so no matter how you’re holding your point-and-share camcorder, you’ll enjoy a clear view every time. Both point-and-share camcorders can also function as cameras, with 8M Pixel (HMX-P300) and 5M Pixel (HMX-P100) still image capture.  <br /><br /> “The HMX-P300 and HMX-P100 are the perfect point-and-share camcorders for customers who get as much enjoyment in sharing their videos as they do from capturing them,” said<b> Mr. Hyunho Chung, Executive Vice President and Head of the Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics</b>. “Sharing our videos with friends and family through social networking sites and blogs is one of the great pleasures in capturing live footage, and we’ve used the latest Samsung technology to make this easier than ever. These point-and-share camcorders are ideal for anyone who has a busy lifestyle, but still enjoys capturing and sharing eye-catching moments on-the-go. They’re small and stylish enough for you to want to take everywhere.”<br /><br /><center><img src="/us/images/news/HMX-P300_2.jpg"></center><br /><br /><b>New experiences in quality and usability</b><br /><br />The HMX-P100 and P300 are built to make sharing movies easier than ever through the One Touch Sharing feature. Once the point-and-share camcorder is connected to a PC via the built-in USB arm, videos will upload automatically, saving time with file transfers and making sure you never forget to share special memories with friends and family. In addition, the HMX-P300 and HMX-P100 can also capture great still photographs, eliminating the need to carry around a separate camera. <br /><br />Both the HMX-P100 and HMX-P300 are built with mobility in mind. Using Micro SD technology, the camcorders are much smaller and more compact than conventional point-and-share camcorders. The slim bodies of the point-and-share camcorders can easily fit into a jacket pocket or handbag, while the built-in USB arms and USB charging features enable users to charge batteries and share images simultaneously without needing an additional cable. <br /><br />The point-and-share camcorders include features to create the best possible image quality out of every situation. The innovative 5M BSI (Back Side Illuminated) CMOS sensor featured on the HMX-P100 records with twice the sensitivity of regular CMOS sensors to reduce image noise and distortion and dramatically enhance recording quality in low-light situations. The AF lens of the HMX-P100 also makes it easy to capture bright and clear movies anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />In addition, the HMX-P300 and HMX-P100 include a number of smart features that make recording simple.

				<![CDATA[
					<b>LAS VEGAS, January 5, 2011</b> – At the International Consumer Electronics Show, Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., continued to raise the industry bar for plasma TVs with its extended plasma TV line-up of 16 new models across six product series.  <br /><br />Offering breathtaking picture quality, advanced connectivity options and superior audio-visual technologies, Samsung’s 2011 ultra-slim plasma TVs add a touch of sophistication and style to any home. All new plasma TVs also offer Samsung’s breakthrough Plasma+1 design, which features a new narrow bezel design that adds 1” of viewable screen size over last year’s products for a greater viewing area without increasing the outside dimensions of the set. The TVs also offer richer connected entertainment options through one of the most comprehensive offering of apps and connected devices, so that people get the most out of their entertainment experience. Select models will offer Samsung’s new Smart Hub, which includes:<br /><br />·         Search All, which makes it easier to search for desired content on your TV and other DLNA-certified connected media storage devices, networked PC and mobile devices, and Internet and video-on-demand services.<br /><br />·         Your Video, which delivers recommendations based on a user’s viewing history.<br /><br />·         Web Browser, which offers full web browsing right from your TV.<br /><br />·         Samsung Apps, the world’s first HDTV-based application store, which offers a range of paid and free apps that help people connect to their various passions – whether in sports, entertainment, information, games or social networking. <br /><br />The latest TV lineup will be on display at Samsung’s booth #12006 in the Central Hall at the International Consumer Electronics Show, which will be held at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), January 6-9, 2011. The Samsung Plasma D6500 series TVs, a CES 2011 Innovations Design and Engineering Award winner, will also be on display in the Grand Lobby at the LVCC. <br /><br />“Samsung continues to deliver against its promise to create products that evolve with the needs and desires of our customers. We expect 3D and smart TV features to become mainstream as people realize the benefits,” said <b>Sangchul Lee, Senior Vice President, Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics.</b> “Such immersive and smart entertainment is best experienced on larger screens and our Plasma+1 feature, a result of breakthrough engineering and design, means more people can enjoy this at home without an increase in cost.”  <br /><br />As the No. 1 brand for TVs in the US and globally, Samsung led the industry in 2010 with the launch of the world’s first 3D TV and today holds over 70 percent of the market share in the US. As 3D content becomes more prevalent, the company expects more consumers to opt for 3D features in their TVs. To this end, it aims to reduce the cost of acquiring a 3D entertainment system – 3D TV, Blu-ray player, 3D glasses and content – in 2011 by more than two-thirds and making 3D features available in a wider range of models. <br /><br />The increase in screen size facilitiates greater interaction and a more immersive overall picture experience when viewing 3D TV content, movies or gaming.<br /><br />Stylish TV with Outstanding Picture Quality and a Larger Viewing Screen.  <br /><br />Samsung’s Plasma D8000 Series is a Full HD plasma TV that is designed to deliver our best viewing experience in 2D and 3D. The D8000 Series features a dark metallic bezel combined with Samsung’s ToC™ border for an understated cool elegance associated with luxury items. More importantly, the thinner bezel makes possible the added inch in screen size without an increase in the overall size of the TV. <br /><div style="margin-left:150px"><br /><img src="/us/images/news/pdp8000.jpg"></div><br /><br />The Plasma D8000 Series features Samsung’s Real Black Filter technology, which reduces the onscreen glare to produce darker blacks and sharper images. The plasma panel has also been redesigned to deliver outstanding black luminance. The TV also includes Samsung’s proprietary Crystal Full HD engine with Cinema Smooth technology that delivers smoother motion effects when watching their favorite Blu-ray discs. These features combine to give the D8000 Series a dynamic contrast ratio of 3,000,000:1, and pristine depth and dimension to onscreen images.  <br /><br />The Plasma D8000 Series is also compatible with Samsung’s 3D active glasses and multi-display Touch Control. This remote can be a second portable TV, offers a QWERTY keyboard for easy text input during web browsing and acts as a universal remote control for your onscreen content. With built-in Wi-Fi, viewers have access to Smart Hub to view and search for content on Samsung Apps or on DLNA-certified devices.  <br /><br />Solid All-Round Performer with Advanced Connectivity Options, 3D Video Processing Technology and Stunning Design <br /><br />Samsung’s ultra-slim Plasma D6500 Series is a 1080p 3D TV that offers a range of features that makes it an outstanding all-round choice for those looking to enhance their TV experience. <br /><br />The Plasma D6500 Series offers a dichotomy in design texture, between cold, black metal and warm, smooth glass. The cabinet consists of a brushed metallic black frame and the translucent mold that encases the frame and uses Samsung’s ToC™ technology to create a luxurious finish. The same pattern is reflected in the silver stand, where a reinforced glass neck is attached to a black matte metal base. With the narrow bezel, Samsung TVs can fit into viewing spaces previously reserved for smaller screen sizes, so for example, a 51-inch TV can fit into a spot previously occupied by a 50-inch screen. <br /><br />With Samsung’s built-in 3D processing technology, viewers can easily up-convert 2D content and render it in high-definition 3D for a richer, more immersive entertainment experience. Its powerful system-on-chip not only renders standard 2D content into 3D entertainment in real-time, but also offers video-enhancing tools that produce sharp, color-rich and smooth pictures. The Plasma D6500 Series connects seamlessly to Samsung’s 3D active glasses, thereby eliminating problems such as interference and strict line-of-sight requirements, so that viewers can enjoy a more stable image and greater flexibility to watch the television from practically any viewing angle. <br /><br />With built-in Wi-Fi, viewers can also stream content to the Plasma D6500 Series from other DLNA-certified devices using Samsung AllShare, as well as access to a broad range of apps via Samsung Apps. <br /><br />CES-specific information may be found at <a href="http://www.samsungces2011.com" target="_blank" style="color:#1922dd">www.samsungces2011.com</a>.

					<b>CES, Las Vegas – January 4, 2011</b> - Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, announced today the launch of the new <b>SH100</b>, a compact Wi-Fi enabled camera that delivers great shots that you can share over the internet and social networks with your friends and family, from wherever you are in the world. The SH100 is set to be Samsung’s leading fully connected camera in 2011, building on the success of the company’s wirelessly connected cameras to date and allowing Samsung to take a dominant position within this growing market.<br /><br />Samsung’s pioneering steps within the connected camera market can be seen in the SH100’s unique innovation, which allows you to connect wirelessly to your other devices with ease. You can use Wi-Fi to connect to your Android® powered Galaxy S™ smartphone, so you can view the shot you’re about to take in real time on your phone. If you’re not happy with it, you can zoom in and out to get the best picture, and then activate the shutter remotely when you’re ready to pose. . This innovation means that the days of running between your camera and your subject, trying to line up the perfect group shot, are over. Users now have total control of their camera in the palm of their hand, from wherever they are in the shot. Users can even use their phone’s GPS to record exactly where they were when they captured their favorite memories. <br /><br />The SH100’s built in Wi-Fi can also automatically back up your shots to your PC by only pushing two buttons, or by using DLNA to wirelessly connect to your HDTV and see your photos and videos right away. Wi-Fi enables you to upload your pictures instantly to your social networking sites such as Facebook, Picasa or Photo Bucket, or email them to individual email addresses straight from the camera. The people you care about can now enjoy your experience from wherever they are. You can also record HD video and share your favorite moments over sites such as YouTube™. To make the upload process of large files easier and quicker, the SH100 includes an account with mobile hotspot provider Boingo™, giving you access to over 200,000 Wi-Fi hotspots worldwide. <br /><br />The SH100 is the latest example of Samsung’s user-focused innovation and design. The company has always carefully researched its target audience, and in 2011, Samsung is applying this research to create unique products for a younger, more digitally connected generation of camera users. The company is also leveraging its strength in other product areas, such as mobile phones, to make emerging camera technologies, such as Wi-Fi, accessible to all camera buyers, even those on smaller budgets. <br /><br />“At Samsung, we are always striving to innovate and you can see this in every product we release,” said <b>Mr. Hyunho Chung, Executive Vice President and Head of the Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics</b>. “From our in-depth consumer research, we know that younger users have different needs from their digital camera. They don’t want to wait until they get home to share their favorite moments with their friends, they want to be able to do this instantly from wherever they are. The SH100 gives young people the chance to bring their world closer, by drawing on Samsung’s technological strength to deliver total connectivity in a compact camera, at an accessible price. Through the SH100, we hope to provide the best product for people looking for ultimate connectivity from their camera, and strengthen Samsung’s leadership in the compact camera category.” <br /><br />Experience the Convenience<br /><br />The SH100 uses built in Wi-Fi capability to deliver unique new experiences for all camera users. By selecting the PC Auto Back-up function, your camera will automatically find your PC and download the latest photos onto it, even if the PC is turned off. This feature is compatible with the Wake-on-LAN (WoL) system which many modern home PCs are already equipped with. <br /><br />Innovation in Control Helps you Capture the Moment<br /><br />The Wi-Fi capability on the SH100 also allows you to use your smartphone as a remote control and viewing device for your camera. If you’re shooting over a crowd at a concert, you can enable the Remote Viewfinder function, meaning that you can hold your camera high over your head while you see a preview of the picture in real time on your phone screen. It’s also ideal for taking self shots as you can zoom in and out using the 5x optical zoom, and access basic menu functions including parameters and shooting modes. When you’re happy with the shot, you can operate the shutter remotely too, and the camera will record the GPS information for photo geo-tagging. <br /><br />Seamlessly Simple<br /><br />Samsung has also used its strength in the smartphone market to develop a new Smart Access user interface (UI) for all of its new compact cameras. The touch based UI works in the same quick, intuitive way as many smartphones. Advanced functions, such as sharing content wirelessly, can be done simply by a few touches of the buttons on the large, clear 3” LCD screen. The Smart Access UI enables users to drag, click and control ‘app-style’ icons, easily flip through photos, and control a range of the camera’s features.<br /><br />The Heart of your Digital Home<br /><br />The SH100 features Samsung AllShare, which uses DLNA technology to allow you to connect to your HDTV and stream content wirelessly. For instance, when you get home from a concert, you can now watch the videos of your favorite songs instantly on your TV. <br /><br />Android and Youtube are registered trademarks of Google Inc.

				<![CDATA[
					<b>LAS VEGAS, NV, January 5, 2011</b> – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, today announced from the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas the latest line up of 3D computer displays, HDTV/ monitors and a Home Theater projector incorporating Samsung’s proprietary 3D technology. Available in 23- and 27-inch configurations, the 7 and 9 Series monitors, along with the<b> SP-A8000 </b>1080p 3D Home Theater projector, will be available on display at Central Hall booth #12006, January 6-9, 2011.<br /><br />“With the explosion in entertainment content from 3D films, television and video games and the increased availability of 3D capture devices like cameras and webcams, gamers, home entertainment enthusiasts and content creators are demanding more functionality from their display devices,” said<b> Young Bae, director of display marketing, Samsung Enterprise Business Division</b>. “Consumers will not only enjoy the latest in Samsung display technology for the best possible 2D experience with the 7 and 9 Series monitors, they will also be able to enjoy a wide variety of native 3D content and, on some models, even watch 2D content in 3D thanks to Samsung’s real-time 2D to 3D conversion technology.<br />”<br /><b><u>Innovative 3D Performance</b></u><br />Samsung has reinvented the 3D monitor experience to allow its users to experience the wide variety of 3D content now available. Unlike other 3D solutions, which only work for video gaming, Samsung’s new 3D monitors and HDTV/monitors also allow users to enjoy 3D movies, 3D TV and user-created 3D content like 3D photos and 3D videos. In order to do this, Samsung has created a new 3D technology, based on 3D panels available only in Samsung displays.<br /><br />The proprietary Samsung 3D panel gives the 7 and 9 Series monitors a hyper realistic 3D playback, which makes them ideal for immersion in intense PC or console gaming, or for watching action-packed video content like movies and sports.<br /><br />The 950 Series Monitor and the 7 and 9 Series HDTV/Monitors can automatically analyze and render 2D content in real-time to stunning 3D, supporting not only PC content, but also content from Blu-ray players, gaming consoles and set-top boxes.<br /><br />Offering a complete 3D solution in a single package, the 7 and 9 Series feature a built-in glasses sync emitter, and they are packaged with a pair of 3D active-shutter glasses and middleware for 3D gaming.<br /><br />The 7 and 9 Series offer Samsung’s highest quality monitor image in a TN panel—whether for 2D or 3D content.  Users will experience the ultimate in color and clarity with Samsung’s new Ultra Clear Panel technology, which combines the vibrancy of a glossy display while maintaining the ease of viewing afforded by an anti-glare matte finish.  The LED-backlit panel boasts 100% sRGB coverage, for the most realistic color reproduction.<br /><br />In addition to these monitors, Samsung further demonstrates its commitment to 3D display technology with the SP-A8000 3D projector. Home users looking to enjoy 3D in a group setting will be able to do so, thanks to the large image the SP-A8000 can project.  The 1,000 ANSI lumen SP-A8000 features a single-bulb, single-lens design. The SP-A8000 also benefits from Samsung’s 3D engine and can convert 2D content to 3D, affording a realistic image and genuine 3D end result.<br /><br /><b>Sophisticated Styling</b><br />Style-conscious consumers will appreciate the aesthetic enhancement the 7 and 9 Series monitors add to a room, with razor-thin screens and unique designs. Most striking, the metallic-silver finished 9 Series features a slim, asymmetrical design that offers a clean, modern look. All circuitry is housed within the display’s base, resulting in a uniformly ultra-slim panel. The 7 Series display sports Samsung’s signature Touch of Color design, which embeds colored accents in the bezel for a stylish, unique look.<br /><br />Adding appeal to eco-conscious users, Samsung’s 7 and 9 Series reduce energy consumption by as much as 40 percent over traditional displays, thanks to the LED-backlit technology. In addition, the 9 Series’ high-gloss front, sleek back and all-aluminum base are comprised of recyclable material and like all of Samsung’s LED displays, is free of mercury and halogens, making it easier to recycle.<br />Users looking to consolidate their TV and PC monitors or utilize the 7 and 9 Series displays as secondary televisions will appreciate the HDTV/Monitor (MFM) versions, which feature an HDTV tuner for live television in addition to PC and AV playback. The HDTV/Monitor 7 and 9 Series displays integrate a convenient picture-in-picture function, allowing for simultaneous activities like viewing live sporting games while managing player stats online.<br /><br />The SP-A8000’s conveniently blends in with any room décor and its glossy black, dolphin-like shape helps it complement the entertainment area, whether incorporated into a modern interior or mounted from the ceiling above.<br /><br /><b>Versatile and Flexible</b><br />For enhanced viewing options and productivity, the 7 and 9 Series are equipped with signature Samsung visual display technologies. The Eco Light Sensor creates a comfortable viewing environment by automatically adjusting the brightness of the screen based on ambient light and Eco Motion Sensor contributes to ease of use and lower energy consumption by automatically turning the display on or off when a user is within or has left the vicinity of the monitor.  <br /><br />The 3D-enabled 7 and 9 Series displays will all be available in March 2011. Display models will retail for TBD. The SP-A8000 will be available beginning January 2011, and will retail for TBD.

					<b>LAS VEGAS, NV, January 5, 2011</b> – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, today introduced from the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas the Central Station. The Samsung Central Station seamlessly connects all elements of the IT workspace, including notebook PC, display, peripherals, network, and AV, providing users with a simple and convenient way to increase productivity. Available in 23- and 27-inch wired and wireless configurations, the Central Station will be available on display at Central Hall booth #12006, January 6-9, 2011.<br /><br />“The Samsung Central Station answers a real need for consumers and business professionals looking to simplify their IT environment so they can move easily from a mobile to desktop setting” said<b> Young Bae, director of display marketing at Samsung Enterprise Business Division</b>. “It enables users to effortlessly connect or disconnect their notebook PC to a wide range of peripheral devices without the inconvenience of having to constantly plug and unplug every time they do so.”<br />  <br /><b>Engineered for the Demanding PC User</b><br />Designed with both the professional and the consumer in mind, Central Station is ideal for corporate offices, home offices and personal users. Power users, such as mobile professionals or connected families, will benefit from the Central Station’s auto wireless detection that finds a laptop equipped with the included wireless USB dongle once it is moved within a 1 meter radius. No cords need to be touched; no settings need to be changed. <br /><br />The Central Station also functions as a second display alongside a connected laptop, freeing users from the constraints of a single, smaller screen. This offers the convenience and portability of a laptop with the bigger workspace of a traditional desktop. In addition, the Central Station’s auto configuration function lets users quickly and easily set up the screen with optimal resolution and screen settings.  Additionally, the USB ports can charge mobile devices for added convenience and utility.<br /><br />Featuring two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 connections for connecting peripherals, the Central Station boasts fast, versatile data transfer and device communication. Central Station also includes an HDMI input, enabling users to connect Blu-ray players, set top boxes, or gaming devices to realize the full potential of Central Station’s 1080p LED backlit display. In addition, users also have the ability to hook up external speakers to better enjoy sound from their connected Blu-ray player or laptop.<br />Central Station is designed to reduce companies’ long-term equipment costs. By eliminating the need to purchase device-specific docking stations, a single Central Station will last through multiple generations of PCs.<br /><br /><b>Simple, Sophisticated Styling</b><br />All four Central Station consumer models sport an elegant dual hinge base, making them height adjustable and simplifying the silhouette into a minimalist desktop display. Two additional professional models both feature a more traditional, fully height-adjustable stand in place of the dual-hinge, perfect for corporate office use.<br /><br />Designed with sleek ergonomics and an enjoyable viewing experience in mind, the Central Station features Samsung’s Magic technologies and a 1080p LED-backlit display that delivers crisp, detailed images and bold color. <br /><br />Championing the signature styling of Samsung display products, the Central Station is available with either a crystal or metallic finish and features Touch of Color construction, which injects a hint of color naturally blended into the bezel.<br /> <br />The Central Station will be available in March 2011.

					<b>January 5, 2011, LAS VEGAS, NV</b> – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, today announced the Samsung MobilePrint app, its first application for printing from Android and iOS mobile devices to Samsung wireless printers, at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The MobilePrint app allows users to print emails, web pages, maps, photos, and Microsoft Office and PDF files faster when traveling for business, working remotely, or visiting with friends and family. The solution will be on display at CES in Central Hall booth #12006, January 6-9, 2011.<br /><br />“Over the past year Samsung has built its leadership in the printer space with the introduction of innovative features like the one-touch print button and AnyWeb Print software for easier web page prints,” said<b> Ken Colby, director of printer marketing at Samsung Electronics Enterprise Business Division</b>. “We are kicking off 2011 by expanding the depth of our printer solutions with the Samsung MobilePrint app which offers a convenient solution for printing from a mobile device, a very real need for today’s smartphone-centric lifestyle.” <br /><br /><b>HASSLE-FREE, SEAMLESS CONNECTIVITY</b><br />The Samsung MobilePrint app is available for Android smartphones, Android tablets and iOS based devices and can be downloaded from the relevant application store or marketplace.   It will detect and connect directly to Samsung wireless printers in the area via WiFi or a network link. Samsung Mobile Print/Scan app users can then print directly from their devices with the click of a button, eliminating the hassle of driver installations and network configurations. <br /><br /><b>SIMPLE EDITING AND SCANNING</b><br />Samsung’s Mobile/Print Scan app also allows users to quickly review and edit documents that have been scanned into a local Samsung printer. Using this feature, mobile devices can detect documents scanned to a local multifunction printer (MFP) or, alternatively, be sent the scanned document by the MFP user. This is an ideal solution for editing document layouts, as it allows mobile edits to be made to the scan’s image quality and file type, and provides a choice between color or black and white scans. <br /><br /><b>FASTER PHOTO AND TRAVEL ITINERARY PRINTS </b><br />Samsung’s Mobile Print/Scan app brings a new dimension to mobile photography by providing users with a way to select and print multiple images simultaneously through their Samsung device’s photo gallery. It also saves time for frequent travelers who need to print e-tickets, flight confirmations or other itineraries at the last minute by using their mobile device’s SD card. <br /><br />The Samsung Mobile Print/Scan app will be available for free this winter. It will be built-in to the Galaxy Tab beginning in 2011. The application will be compatible with all existing and new Samsung wireless and network printers.<br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics America Enterprise Business Division</b><br />Based in Ridgefield Park, N.J., Samsung’s Enterprise Business Division (EBD) is a division of Samsung Electronics America (SEA), a U.S. subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.

					<b>LAS VEGAS – McCarran International Airport and Samsung Electronics America</b> showcased a 100-screen video wall before media and advertisers today at the airport’s D Concourse Rotunda, tipping the hat to delegates of the 2011 International Consumer Electronics Show to be held in Las Vegas Jan. 6-9. The screen’s visual catch comes from the ultra-thin bezel around each monitor that gives the appearance that the tiled formation is one solid piece. <br /><br />The giant display measures 33 feet by 19 feet and is expected to be the largest-known video wall in a U.S. airport. Samsung and McCarran officials are pursuing this lofty claim with an application to the Guinness Book of World Records. Word from the authority on record-breaking achievement is expected within 60 to 90 days.<br /><br />“McCarran is one of the most technologically driven airports in the aviation industry,” said <b>Director of Aviation Randall H. Walker</b>. “We’re at it again with this landmark digital video wall. Its eye-catching stature allows the airport and advertisers to speak to travelers from all corners of the world, and also presents a unique opportunity to increase revenue."<br /><br />Offering up to four-times the standard high-definition quality, the panoramic display is expected to be an immediate hot spot for advertisers in high-end fashion, jewelry, entertainment, dining, auto and special events. Once the airport’s new Terminal 3 opens in 2012, the video wall is expected to garner even more attention from the ad community due to its location directly above the Terminal 3 tram station. <br /><br />This display is only one element of the new comprehensive digital video network at McCarran. Four smaller displays are located at the airport’s A, B and C concourses using three to 10 screens each. <br /><br />Alliance Airport Advertising, which manages McCarran’s indoor advertising contracts, is largely responsible for solidifying the McCarran-Samsung partnership. Its efforts included drafting plans for the engineering and installation of the final digital video network. Alliance estimates that the video walls will produce an additional $500,000 to $1 million in gross advertising revenue for the airport each year.<br /><br />"This project has taken hundreds of hours of research and collaboration among Samsung, McCarran, Alliance and the multiple contractors who designed, built, installed and operate this system," said Shauna Forsythe, chief executive officer of Alliance. “The quality and clarity of our new digital advertising network will surpass anything in the industry and will provide advertisers a new and engaging way to reach the upscale traveler.”<br /><br />“Samsung is a world leader in display technology and we saw this as a great opportunity to display our product in a world-class airport that attracts visitors from around the world,” said <b>Doug Albregts, vice president of sales and marketing at Samsung Electronics America</b>.  “We are proud to partner with McCarran International Airport to showcase this state-of-the-art digital video display network.” <br /><br /><b>About Alliance Airport Advertising</b><br />Alliance Airport Advertising, a division of Alliance Corporation, is a Nevada-based company that specializes in creating compelling advertising, branding and sponsorship programs in airport environments. <br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics America Enterprise Business Division</b> <br />Based in Ridgefield Park, N.J., Samsung’s Enterprise Business Division (EBD) is a division of Samsung Electronics America (SEA), a U.S. subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.

					<b>Ridgefield Park, NJ (January 3, 2010)</b> – Samsung Electronics America, Inc., a market leader and award-winning innovator in digital consumer electronics and information technology, today announced three new lines of consumer external hard disk drives, including two new portable drives and a new desktop drive. All of the new drives feature distinctive styling as well as SuperSpeed USB 3.0 interfaces. USB 3.0 provides data transfer rates of up to 5 gigabits per second, allowing users to transfer a 25-gigabyte high-definition movie in just four minutes, compared with 13 minutes for previous USB 2.0 interface drives.<br /><br />“These new external drives offer outstanding performance and style,” said<b> Reid Sullivan, senior vice president of mobile entertainment marketing, Samsung Electronics America</b>. “With their wide range of capacities, features and price points they offer a variety of attractive choices for today’s storage-hungry consumers looking for mobile and backup solutions.”<br /><br />Samsung’s new portable external drives offer up to 1 terabyte (TB) capacity in a compact, easy-to-transport format with curved sides for a comfortable grip and sleek, Scandinavia-inspired styling. Their wave-like matte finish hides scratches and fingerprints. . The new portable drive will be available in four colors; Brown black, Noble beige, Clay orange and Mist gray.<br /><br />Samsung’s premium portable drives also offer up to 1TB capacity, but add enhanced backup and security software, as well as elegant, high-gloss cases embedded with a multi-layered wave pattern in three jewel-tone colors; Onyx black, Sapphire blue and Coral pink. Their second-generation software offers a feature-rich suite of tools with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. The newly implemented 256-bit Full Disk Encryption provides additional security on a hardware basis. Auto backup software supports both automatic and continuous data backup, so that users' files are backed up automatically every time they are changed or newly created. SecretZone™ allows users to create a secure virtual drive, and SafetyKey™ software provides encrypted data backup and password-setting. A convenient USB docking station will be sold separately for both the basic and premium line products, allowing users to easily connect and transfer data to a PC.<br /><br />Samsung’s new external drives for desktop PCs offer up to 2TB capacity in simple and refined cases, which take their design cues from the portable drive family. Rounded corners give them a slimmer form factor for reduced desktop space, while LED lights at the bottom of the drives indicate their operation status. With 1TB, 1.5TB and 2TB storage capacities, the new desktop drives will be available in Brown black and Noble beige.<br /><br />All three new external storage lines will be available through leading U.S. retailers in April, with pricing to be announced at that time.<br /><br /><b>About Samsung Electronics America, Inc. </b><br />Samsung Electronics America, Inc.

					<b>RIDGEFIELD PARK, N.J., September 2, 2010</b> – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, today announced a series of new mobile PC products that combine Samsung’s signature style and premium performance for use at home, in the office, or on-the-go.  The new <b>QX410, SF510, RF510 and RF710 laptops</b> and the NF series netbooks showcase Samsung’s continued dedication to innovation in mobile computing, and set a new standard for premium and functional design at any price point.<br /><br />“Samsung continues to evolve our mobile PC line-up creating a sleeker, more stylish and technologically superior product perfect for professionals, students, or multimedia-focused consumers,” said<b> Todd Bouman, director of product marketing at Samsung Enterprise Business Division</b>.  “More importantly, the technological innovations within the QX, SF, RF and NF series of mobile PCs underscore Samsung’s position as a leader in mobile computing, offering consumers the performance they’ve come to expect in an aesthetically pleasing package.”<br /><br /><b>QX410: Superior Design, Unbeatable Performance</b><br />At just under one inch in thickness, Samsung’s new QX410 laptop combines a light-weight ultra-chic aluminum design and unparalleled battery performance to create an elegantly streamlined and efficient computing machine.  <br /><br />Centered on Samsung’s hallmark edge-to-edge 14-inch HD SuperBright™ LED display, the QX410 integrates an all-new buttonless, easily configurable multi-function gesture pad, introducing users to a host of multi-finger interface commands while increasing accuracy and speed.<br /><br />Additionally, the QX410 is powered by a state-of-the-art Intel® CoreTM i5 processor.  Further complementing the QX410’s performance is a hybrid graphics system, optimized on-the-go based on users’ needs.  NVIDIA® OptimusTM automatically switches between the onboard Intel graphics and NVIDIA discrete graphics to efficiently manage battery life for basic applications, also delivering high-quality performance for intensive activities like gaming and multimedia on-demand.<br /><br />The QX410 makes use of Samsung’s new lithium polymer batteries, which achieve up to 7 hours of battery life on average.  Lithium polymer batteries extend the life of the product with double the lifespan for up to 3 years or 1,000 charging cycles.<br /><br /><b>RF510 and RF710: Premium Performance Powerhouses</b><br />The RF510 and RF710 laptops emphasize extreme performance, while maintaining a sleek and refined style.   They are accentuated by a distinctive black radial pattern on the display enclosure and a two-tone interior design.  <br /><br />Powered by either an Intel® CoreTM i5 or i7 processor with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology, the RF510 and RF710 take aim at gamers, multimedia aficionados and design buffs offering extreme computing power.  Further complementing the processor are powerful NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M graphics with 1 GB of dedicated memory delivering up to 30 times better performance over integrated graphics bringing hyper-realistic gaming to life or allowing for easy photos and videos editing.  With these applications in mind, the RF710 notebook features two hard drive bays making the laptop capable of carrying over 1TB of storage allowing users to house their entire media library on their laptop.  The RF series also introduces USB 3.0 to Samsung’s laptop line-up.<br /><br />SuperBright™ LED displays enhance the experience with HD+ (1600x900) resolution in the RF710 and HD (1366 x 768) resolution in the RF510, making them the ultimate choice for multimedia applications. Additionally, the RF-series laptops have full, island-style keyboards with number pads for optimal gaming and graphic applications.  Standard in the RF710, a Blu-ray drive allows users to watch their favorite HD movies on Samsung’s incredible SuperBright LED backlit display. <br /><br /><b>SF510: Sleek, Simple and Sophisticated</b><br />Integrating a uniquely contoured clamshell design, the new SF510 is hip and sophisticated without sacrificing computing power or functionality. Gently cradling the ultra-sharp 15.6-inch SuperBright HD LED backlit display in an ivory exterior and chocolate interior design, the SF510 features fluid and ergonomic design.  Moreover, it conveniently places control in the user’s hands, with the multi-touch gesture pad and easily identifiable quick-access buttons for volume and WiFi for simple, intuitive operation.<br /><br />The SF510 is powered by an Intel® CoreTM i3 processor and like the QX series, capitalizes on Samsung’s new lithium polymer batteries offering up to 7 hours of battery life for users.  The SF510, with its ultra portable, stylish design and powerful performance, makes anytime, anywhere mobile computing a practical and affordable reality.<br /><br /><b>Enhanced Usability and Connectivity </b><br />The QX, SF, and RF laptops can communicate with other Samsung devices with Easy File Share,  a simple  to use peer-to-peer networking feature that allows users to quickly and securely exchange files, images, movies, and music wirelessly with any other laptop, netbook or wireless-enabled PC.  Samsung’s AllShareTM technology features an intuitive interface that makes it easy to broadcast content over a user’s WiFi network to Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) enabled devices like HDTVs and even mobile phones.  <br /><br />Samsung’s Support Center ensures all this content can stay safe, or can help troubleshoot any particular problem.  Accessible with a keyboard shortcut, the Support Center helps users manage their system settings or can setup tech-support web chat.  Samsung’s Back-up & Recovery Solution also allows users to create and restore back-ups of system data on the device, or on a network or removable storage device.<br /><br />Also enhancing usability is Samsung’s Fast Start feature, which easily allows the user to put their laptop or netbook in an advanced state of sleep, to reduce power consumption while the device is not in use. The user’s session can then be restored in as little as 3 seconds.<br /><br />To help improve the laptop audio experience, the new QX, RF and SF series laptops feature Samsung’s new True2SoundTM audio system, which delivers a more natural and realistic auditory experience with round speakers and a bigger acoustic chamber.  Enhanced bass, crystal clear dialog and better definition control for maximum clarity is provided through SRS Premium Sound™ processing.<br /><br />Lastly, focusing on convenience and connectivity, the new laptops boast built-in WiMax in the SF and QX series, and utilize the latest in Wi-Fi and USB Sleep & Charge technologies.  <br /><br /><b>NF Series: Ultra Light, Ultra Portable, Ultra Capable</b><br />Taking a style cue from the SF-series laptops, the NF Series netbooks provide users with an ultra-portable solution to mobile computing.  Encapsulated by a light-weight contoured clamshell case, the NF210, with ivory exterior and chocolate interior, features an Intel® Atom N455 processor and incredible battery performance of up to 14 hours, making the NF210 an all-day computing companion.<br /><br />The NF210 features a crystal clear HD LED backlit display for mobile enjoyment and work applications on-the-go.  Additionally, the NF210 can quickly connect PC-to-PC over ad-hoc WiFi connections, simply and easily.  For the ultimate in easy home networking, the AllShareTM feature allows users to share and play videos, photos, and music across a range of Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) certified devices, including TVs, cameras and handsets.<br /><br /><b>QX410 Key Features:</b><br />•	CPU: Intel® CoreTM i5 processor (i5-460M)<br />•	Genuine Windows® 7 Home Premium 64-bit<br />•	Memory: 4GB DDR3<br />•	Hard Drive: Up to640GB <br />•	Screen: 14-inch HD LED backlit display <br />•	Resolution: 1366 x 768<br />•	Graphics: Hybrid Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 310M w/ 512MB dedicated RAM<br />•	Audio technology: True2SoundTM SRS Premium SoundTM<br />•	Optical Drive: DVD Super Multi DL<br />•	Battery: Lithium polymer; up to 7 hrs<br />•	Speakers: 3 W Stereo Speaker (1.5 W x 2)<br />•	Wireless: 802.11b/g/n; WiMax<br />•	4-in-1 media reader<br />•	Weight: 5 lbs.<br />•	MSRP: $899<br /><br /><b>SF510 Key Features:</b><br />•	CPU: Intel® CoreTM i3 processor (i3-370M)<br />•	Genuine Windows® 7 Home Premium 64-bit<br />•	Memory: 4GB DDR3<br />•	Hard Drive: Up to500GB<br />•	Screen: 15.6-inch SuperBright HD LED backlit display <br />•	Resolution: 1366 x 768<br />•	Graphics: Intel HD Graphics<br />•	Audio technology: True2SoundTM SRS Premium SoundTM<br />•	Optical Drive: DVD Super Multi DL<br />•	Battery: Lithium polymer; up to 7 hrs<br />•	Wireless: 802.11b/g/n; WiMax<br />•	4-in-1 media reader<br />•	Weight: 5.3 lbs.<br />•	MSRP: $799<br /><br /><b>RF510-S01 / RF510-S02 / RF710 Key Features:</b><br />•	CPU: <br />o	RF510-S02 & RF710 Intel® CoreTM i7 processor (i7-720QM)<br />o	RF510-S01 Intel® Core™ i5 processor (i5-460M)<br />•	Genuine Windows® 7 Home Premium 64-bit<br />•	Memory: 4GB DDR3<br />•	Hard Drive: Dual-bay architecture with up to 640GB drive (RF510-S02/RF710) & up to 500GB for RF510-S01<br />•	Screen: <br />o	RF510: 15.6-inch SuperBright HD LED backlit display<br />o	RF710: 17.3-inch SuperBright HD LED backlit display<br />•	Resolution: <br />o	RF510: 1366x768<br />o	RF710: 1600x900<br />•	Graphics: Discreet NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M with 1GB dedicated memory<br />•	Audio technology: True2SoundTM SRS Premium SoundTM<br />•	Optical Drive: RF510 DVD Super Multi DL; RF710: Blu-ray optical drive<br />•	Battery: Lithium Ion; up to 4.5 hrs<br />•	Connectivity: 802.11b/g/n; Bluetooth 3.0, Wired 10/100/1000<br />•	Weight: RF510: 5.7 lbs.; RF710: 6.4 lbs.<br />•	MSRP: <br />o	RF510-S02 w/ Intel® CoreTM i7: $1,079<br />o	RF510-S01 w/ Intel® CoreTM i5: $939<br />o	RF710: $1,099<br /><br /><b>NF210 Key Specs:</b><br />•	CPU: Intel® AtomTM N455 processor<br />•	Genuine Windows® 7 Starter<br />•	Memory: 1GB DDR3<br />•	Hard Drive: Up to 250GB<br />•	Screen: 10.1-inch HD LED backlit display <br />•	Resolution: 1024x600<br />•	Graphics: Intel GMA3150 Integrated graphics<br />•	Speakers: 3 W Stereo Speaker (1.5 W x 2)<br />•	Battery: up to 14 hrs<br />•	Wireless: 802.11b/g/n <br />•	Weight: 2.97 lbs.<br />•	MSRP: $379<br /><br />The QX, SF and RF-series notebooks and the NF-series netbook will be available in Fall 2010.

				<![CDATA[
					DALLAS, June 17, 2010 — AT&T* and Samsung Telecommunications America (Samsung Mobile), the No. 1 mobile phone provider in the U.S.**, today announced the upcoming availability of the Samsung Captivate™, a Galaxy S™ smartphone. The Android™ 2.1-powered Samsung Captivate will bring users a fully integrated entertainment, messaging and social networking experience packaged in an alluring, streamlined design surrounding a stunning 4-inch display.<br /><br />The Captivate’s powerful set of Web-based features is maximized with the addition of AT&T’s High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) 7.2 Mbps technology, which provides a considerable speed boost to the nation’s fastest 3G network when paired with expanded backhaul. Speed plus AT&T’s dedicated focus to mobilize everything – including video content, social networking, music and messaging – is reflected in Captivate’s strong feature set.<br /><br />The Captivate represents a new breed of smartphones powered by the open and innovative Android platform, with full support of Google Mobile Services including Android Market, Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Google Talk and more. . Users can also access the Android Market™ and customize their experience with more than 60,000 exciting and useful applications. The Captivate also features Samsung’s Super AMOLED display screen technology, a 1 GHz Samsung Hummingbird Application Processor and Samsung Social Hub, a feature that integrates the user’s social networking services, messages, personal and business email, calendars and contacts.<br /><br />”Add up Captivate’s amazing screen, huge amounts of onboard storage, a super-fast processor, all fueled by the nation’s fastest 3G network and a nationwide Wi-Fi network and you get a smartphone we know our customers will crave,” said Jeff Bradley, senior vice president, Devices, AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets.<br /><br />“With the launch of the Captivate, AT&T customers will experience a groundbreaking handset with world class features that are unique to Samsung’s Galaxy S class of devices, including Samsung’s Super AMOLED screen technology and 1GHz Hummingbird Application Processor,” said Omar Khan, chief strategy officer for Samsung Mobile. “The Captivate represents a new breed of smartphone that will truly change and enrich the way consumers interact with their device on an everyday basis.”<br /><br />Leading Hardware Features<br /><br />The Captivate provides a premium viewing experience on its large, brilliant 4-inch display powered by Samsung’s Super AMOLED touch screen technology. Super AMOLED technology yields thinner displays, delivering one of the thinnest, most responsive full-featured smartphones in the industry. Samsung’s innovative display technology makes watching movies, viewing videos and playing games come to life like never before, even in bright light and outdoor environments.<br /><br />In addition, the Samsung Captivate is designed with a six-axis sensor that combines the smartphone’s accelerometer and gyroscope to provide a smooth, fluid gaming experience when the user is tilting the device up or down or panning the phone to the left or right. The Captivate’s user interface also supports a series of advanced touch screen gestures capabilities including multi-touch pinch, long tap and zoom and vertical and horizontal swiping. This series of versatile gestures provide easier and quicker access to many applications including location-based services, Web browsing and digital photos.<br /><br />Powering the Captivate is a 1 GHz Samsung Hummingbird Application Processor, which produces amazing 3-D graphics, faster upload and download times and full richness of HD-like multimedia content. The Captivate is also outfitted with 3D sound capabilities, giving the user surround-sound stereo quality, when listening on hard-wired headphones.<br /><br />Features for All Users<br /><br />The Captivate keeps users connected with Samsung’s Social Hub, which is built around Messaging and Contacts, both of which initiate the sending and receiving of information, whether it is e-mail, instant messaging, social network updates or SMS messages. Additionally, calendar information from portal calendars, such as Google Calendar™, and social networking services are displayed together in one calendar with two-way synchronization. The familiar text messaging experience is enhanced with group messaging and “reply all” functionality for up to 10 contacts, a threaded conversations format, a consolidated inbox, and enhanced multi-media display.<br /><br />In addition, AT&T customers who choose Captivate can take advantage of AT&T Address Book. A Web-based service, AT&T Address Book syncs contacts to an online address book so customers can access and manage their mobile contacts from their handset – or their PC. Also available to users at no additional charge is access to AT&T’s entire national Wi-Fi network -- any Captivate with the Wi-Fi turned on will automatically connect when in range.<br /><br />Not just for social networking and messaging, the Captivate truly brings your home and office computer to the palm of your hand with support for push email and integrated calendar services, including Google™ and Yahoo for consumers and small businesses and ActiveSync for enterprise users. Messaging is simple and easy with the Captivate’s virtual QWERTY keyboard with Swype technology, which allows users to input text faster and in a more intuitive way with one continuous finger motion across the screen keyboard.<br /><br />True Mobile Entertainment<br /><br />In addition, the Captivate features best-in-class entertainment features, including future access to Samsung Media Hub, a full library of video and literary content powered by some of the biggest names in entertainment. Samsung Mobile looks forward to sharing additional information about Media Hub in the near future and the Captivate will feature a pre-loaded app that can take users to download Media Hub in the future. The Captivate features Samsung’s All Share application, which enables inter-device connectivity through DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) technology, allowing users to send user-generated video content wirelessly to other DLNA-enabled devices, such as TV’s, monitors and laptops, allowing for a rich, interactive entertainment experience.<br /><br />The Captivate is packed full of features that enhance users’ daily life, including a 5.0-megapixel camera/ camcorder with auto-focus and HD video recording (720p)***, MP3 player, 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and expandable memory for photos, videos and music, up to 16 GB. This combined with an on-board 16 GB of storage allows for up to 32 GB of capacity for music and video.<br /><br />The Captivate also includes AT&T Navigator, which offers voice-guided and visual turn-by-turn GPS driving directions with automatic reroute, full-color maps, and real-time traffic alerts and AT&T Family Map, which gives families the ability to track a child's location from a PC or cell phone and request location updates at any time.<br /><br />Additional key specifications of the Captivate include Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n), full HTML browser with tap & hold zoom), Bluetooth® 3.0 technology. The Captivate also includes tri-band 3G connectivity and quad-band GSM technology, which allows AT&T customers to make calls in more than 220 countries and download data in more than 195.<br /><br />The Samsung Captivate is scheduled for release in the coming months at AT&T retail locations nationwide or at www.att.com/wireless.

When not actively in use, Social Buzz continues running in the background and delivers pop-up message notifications to the phone’s home screen ensuring you are in the know on the latest updates. While in use, it gives the option to visit each social networking screen separately or visit an aggregated screen that includes messages from all communities in one simple-to-access place.<br /> <br />“We’re proud to continue the popular Gravity series of devices with sleeker designs and a fully customizable touch screen on the Gravity T, as well as introduce the Smiley with T-Mobile,” said Omar Khan, chief strategy officer for Samsung Mobile. “These three phones each offer top-notch messaging features and multimedia favorites together in one device.”<br /> <br />Following the success of the Samsung Gravity® and Gravity® 2, Samsung Mobile and T-Mobile are continuing the series with the availability of the Samsung Gravity® 3 and Samsung Gravity® T.

				<![CDATA[
					RIDGEFIELD PARK, N.J., June 23, 2010 – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, recently unveiled its newest multifunction wireless printer geared toward small business, home office and personal at-home users. The Samsung SCX-4623FW has the high level performance found in larger multifunction printers, but the size, price and easy installation features to accommodate smaller user groups.<br /><br /><br />“Customers are looking for an easy-to-use, worry-free printer with great features and value---simply more. This is what we aim to achieve in the products we provide,” said Ken Colby, director of printer marketing at Samsung Electronics Information Technology Division.“We are continuously developing features and functions that save customers time; we’ve introduced one-touch Wi-Fi Protected Set-Up feature for hassle-free printer installation and AnyWeb Print software to select only what you want to print.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />SIMPLY MORE<br /><br />The SCX-4623FW features numerous functions to make printing convenient for any use. With the new one-touch WPS button, users can connect wirelessly with just one touch of a button. After simply selecting the WPS button on the router and then on the printer, the SCX-4623FW will automatically connect to the wireless network.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The SCX-4623FW continues to be easy to use with Samsung’s AnyWeb Print software, which allows users to print just the information they need, rather than printing several Web pages. Using this software, users can select, drag and drop contents of interest from various Web pages onto a blank page which can then be saved or printed.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The printer’s blue navigational compass guides users through several functions and features for your printing, scanning, faxing and copying needs. Additionally, the easy on/off button on the front panel continues to make the SCX-4623FW user friendly.<br /><br /> <br /><br />SLEEK DESIGN<br /><br />Just like the non-wireless version, the SCX-4623F, the SCX-4623FW comes in a stylish black design to compliment other Samsung office devices from monitors to mobile PCs. Its rounded edges and compact size (12.6”x16.4”x16.1”) makes the SCX-4623FW a perfect fit for home office spaces.<br /><br /> <br /><br />With a large 250 page cassette tray, the enclosed paper cassette prevents dust build for cleaner documents and fewer visits to refill paper.<br /><br /> <br /><br />VALUE WITHOUT COMPROMISE<br /><br />With a print speed of up to 23 pages per minute (ppm), the SCX-4623FW proves that a small office or home printer doesn’t have to compromise on performance. Additionally, two variations of toner yield cartridges give you the option to choose between a standard 1.5K yield and 2.5K yield to fit to your printing needs.<br /> <br /><br />Because the SCX-4623FW shares the same toners as Samsung’s ML-2525 series, SCX-4600 and SCX-4623F printers, the same toner can be used across various machines for any type of environment. .<br /> <br /><br />The SCX-4623FW is Energy Star compliant and eco-sensitive with less than 45W of energy in standby mode and 10W in sleep mode.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The SCX-4623FW will be available at the end of June for $249.99 at select retailers and e-tailers, which can be located by calling 1-800-SAMSUNG or by visiting www.samsung.com.<br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics America Information Technology Division<br />Samsung’s Information Technology Division (ITD) is one of the fastest growing IT companies in the U.S., and is committed to serving the IT needs of consumers ranging from the home user to the Fortune 500 elite, and supports the valued channel partners who serve our customers.

In the area of customers’ perceptions of value, Sprint now leads both AT&T and Verizon. The company also achieved an impressive improvement in the area of customer loyalty. With these gains, the company’s overall ACSI score jumped 14 points over the last two years. In the last six years of the ACSI survey, no other company has improved its satisfaction score by that many points in a two-year period.<br /><br />The improvements in the ACSI survey come as Sprint has seen nine consecutive quarters of improved customer satisfaction and first call resolution. The company’s improvements have also been recognized by other independent third-parties, including Sprint winning the #1 spot for both overall satisfaction for wireless voice service providers and wireless data service providers in a Yankee Group and Mobile Enterprise magazine survey of large business decision makers. Sprint also ranked high in small and medium business customer satisfaction. Also noteworthy was Sprint’s two-year Reputation Pulse™ score increase in Reputation Institute’s 2010 U.S. Most Reputable Companies Study (published annually in Forbes). Sprint’s 18.22 percent gain puts its improvement in the top 10 percent of the 150 largest U.S. companies, ahead of both AT&T and Verizon.<br /><br />About Sprint Nextel<br />Sprint Nextel offers a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications services bringing the freedom of mobility to consumers, businesses and government users. Sprint Nextel served more than 48 million customers at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and is widely recognized for developing, engineering and deploying innovative technologies, and is the first and only wireless 4G service from a national carrier in the United States; offering industry-leading mobile data services, leading prepaid brands including Virgin Mobile USA, Boost Mobile, Common Cents Mobile and Assurance Wireless and instant national and international push-to-talk capabilities; and a global Tier 1 Internet backbone.

It also features a powerful processor to make it a snap to maneuver within the device.<br /> <br />“Samsung Intercept is a valuable addition to our growing portfolio of Android phones with a rich Internet browsing experience, visual voicemail and practically all of the latest must-have features,” said Kevin Packingham, senior vice president of product development for Sprint. “Best of all, at this price, we are able to bring the Android experience to a broader audience that will appreciate the versatility that comes with access to thousands of apps on Android Market.

Sprint is the most improved company in customer satisfaction, across all industries, over the last two years, according to results from the 2010 American Customer Satisfaction Index.<br /> <br />Sprint’s improvement was driven in part by substantial gains in two aspects of the survey. In the area of customers’ perceptions of value, Sprint now leads both AT&T and Verizon. The company also achieved an impressive improvement in the area of customer loyalty. With these gains, the company’s overall ACSI score jumped 14 points during the last two years. In the last six years of the ACSI survey, no other company has improved its satisfaction score by that many points in a two-year period.<br /> <br />The improvements in the ACSI survey come as Sprint has seen nine consecutive quarters of improved customer satisfaction and first call resolution. The company’s improvements have also been recognized by other independent third-parties, including Sprint winning the #1 spot for both overall satisfaction for wireless voice service providers and wireless data service providers in a Yankee Group and Mobile Enterprise magazine survey of large business decision makers. Sprint also ranked high in small and medium business customer satisfaction. Also noteworthy was Sprint’s two-year Reputation Pulse™ score increase in Reputation Institute’s 2010 U.S. Most Reputable Companies Study (published annually in Forbes). Sprint’s 18.22 percent gain puts its improvement in the top 10 percent of the 150 largest U.S. companies, ahead of both AT&T and Verizon.<br /> <br />Sprint is also the first national wireless carrier to test, launch and market 4G technology, offering wireless 4G service today for select devices in 36 markets. In 2010, Sprint expects to launch 4G service in multiple markets, including Boston, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Los Angeles,Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. For information, visit www.sprint.com/4G.<br /> <br />About Sprint Nextel<br />Sprint Nextel offers a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications services bringing the freedom of mobility to consumers, businesses and government users. Sprint Nextel served more than 48 million customers at the end of the first quarter of 2010 and is widely recognized for developing, engineering and deploying innovative technologies, and is the first and only wireless 4G service from a national carrier in the United States; offering industry-leading mobile data services, leading prepaid brands including Virgin Mobile USA, Boost Mobile, Common Cents Mobile and Assurance Wireless and instant national and international push-to-talk capabilities; and a global Tier 1 Internet backbone.

				<![CDATA[
					Ridgefield Park, NJ (July 21, 2010) – Samsung Electronics. Co. Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technology, today unveiled the latest additions to its DualView camera portfolio, the 14.2 mega-pixel ST600 and ST100. Reinforcing the company’s position as a global leader in the digital imaging industry and a driver of innovation, the ST600 and ST100 build off of the success of the TL225 and TL220, offering consumers a stylish design, a full-range of smart and easy-to-use features, and Samsung’s revolutionary dual LCD technology.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The new flagship models of the Samsung DualView camera family, the ST600 and ST100 each received an upgrade to their front LCD screens, activated by a simple tap, which now measure 1.8” compared to the 1.5” front LCD screens found on their DualView predecessors. With larger front LCD screens, the ST600 and ST100 make it easier for consumers to properly frame themselves in their photos and videos and be part of the action by stepping out from behind the camera and joining friends and family in front. The Samsung DualView ST600 and ST100 are also available in stylish, mood-inspired colors, including purple (ST600) and pink (ST100), and are encased in a slim and sleek compact frame with a metallic finish to deliver a new sense of fun and modern functionality that will ensure users stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />“Today’s launch is an important landmark for Samsung as it reinforces our position as a leading innovator in the digital camera market,” said SJ Park, President of Samsung Digital Imaging Division. “Unlike any other feature found on digital cameras, consumers immediately recognize the value of what our dual LCD technology can do for them. There is no learning curve or technical understanding that must be achieved as it is a natural extension of what our customers are already doing. Samsung is looking to simplify that task with the new ST600 and ST100, ensuring they have the ability to take the perfect profile shot, and never have to miss that perfect picture moment with family and friends, even if they’re not behind the camera.”<br /><br />High-Quality Optics and Images<br />The Samsung DualView ST600 and ST100 come equipped with high-quality Schneider KREUZNACH lenses which are supported by Optical and Digital Image Stabilization to help consumers produce blur-free images. The ST600 combines a powerful 27mm wide-angle focal length with a 5x optical zoom, while the ST100 is the first Samsung DualView digital camera to feature an internal, 5x optical zoom, which keeps the design optimally chic (35mm focal-length).<br /><br />Innovative and Easy-to-Use Functions<br />The new ST600 and ST100 feature Samsung’s Smart Auto (Still & Movie) scene recognition technology. With Smart Auto (Still & Movie) selected, the ST600 and ST100 take the guess work out of taking a great photo or video. Smart Auto (Still & Movie) analyzes key elements of the composition of the image such as color, brightness, motion and subject and then selects the appropriate scene mode which will produce the best results.<br /><br /><br /><br />Additional features offered by the cameras’ front LCD screens include a self-portrait mode, a couples mode which will automatically snap a photo when it detects two faces tilted toward each other, a children’s setting which will play a cartoon animation with sound to encourage young ones to smile for the camera, and a self-timer which provides a visual countdown so that everyone posing for a photo knows exactly when to smile. The newest feature incorporated into the front LCD screen is Samsung’s jump shot mode. When set to jump shot mode, the front LCD will provide a visual queue to those in front of the camera to jump in unison, and immediately trigger the ST600 or ST100 to take three consecutive images to help users capture an image that essentially freezes their subjects in mid-air.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The ST600 and ST100 also incorporate Samsung’s Smart Gesture User Interface (UI) which allows for the quick access and use of key features with either a simple tilt or a hand gesture. Users can quickly scroll through photos by slightly tilting the device in either direction, swiping their finger across the screen, or by selecting the appropriate photos for a slide show. Managing images is also easy with the ST600 and ST100.<br /><br />Pricing:<br />Samsung DualView ST600 - $329.99<br />Samsung DualView ST100 - $349.99<br /><br />* Specifications are subject to change without notice.<br /><br />For additional information regarding Samsung’s 2010 digital imaging product lineup, including press releases, video content and product images, please visit www.samsung.com/newsroom.<br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd<br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion. Employing approximately 188,000 people in 185 offices across 65 countries, the company consists of eight independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Digital Imaging, Semiconductor and LCD.

				<![CDATA[
					Ridgefield Park, NJ (July 28, 2010) –  Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today added to its point-and-shoot camcorder lineup with the introduction of the innovative HMX-E10. Offering full-HD resolution, the Samsung HMX-E10 is highlighted by a versatile, 270-degree swiveling lens that enhances consumers’ creativity and allows them to add their own unique views to their video by being able to record from just about any angle. The HMX-E10’s swiveling lens also brings a new sense of fun to recording video, and gives consumers the ability to step out from behind the camcorder and put themselves in the frame with their friends and family.<br /><br /><br />Samsung has also strived to simplify the way consumers share content with others through the HMX-E10, with the innovative built-in USB port function. The USB feature enables users to connect the camcorder directly to any computer without added attachments like a USB cable, allowing consumers to share important moments wherever they are.. The USB connection can also be used to charge the battery.<br /><br /><br />“Samsung is focused on introducing features to its camcorders which address unmet needs and take the video recording experience to new levels for consumers,” said Sangjin Park, President of the Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics. “The HMX-E10 offers the image quality, ultra-compact design and built-in USB technology that consumers expect from this class of camcorder, but goes a step beyond, offering features such as a swiveling lens, versatile LCD screen and a range of smart filters, which give users the ability to do more and express their creativity.”<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />Easy Connectivity and Sharing<br />Samsung designed the HMX-E10 to help simplify the way consumers share their content with others. The camcorder features a built-in USB connection that gives users the ability to connect the camcorder to any computer without having to worry about always carrying around a separate USB cable. In addition, the HMX-E10 is also loaded with Samsung’s play edit sharing program, called intelli studio. This intuitive program gives users the ability to edit and play their video from any computer without having to install supporting software. This is extremely useful when traveling or when consumers are away from the own personal computers.<br /><br />An interactive and onscreen “upload” button on the HMX-E10 also makes uploading footage to the Web effortless. When connected to a computer with an internet connection, the one-touch “upload” button links directly to a specified content sharing Web site, such as YouTube™, and reduces the number of steps needed to successfully upload and share video.<br /><br />High-Performance Sensor and Versatile Display<br />At the heart of the HMX-E10 is a large, high-performance 1/3.2 inch CMOS sensor that captures impressive 1920x1080 full HD resolution video (30p / H.264) as well as eight mega pixel digital still images. On the back of the camcorder is a versatile, 2.7-inch wide, touch screen LCD that is set vertically. When recording video, the HMX-E10’s LCD screen is divided into two sections; the top displays the live view showing what is currently in the frame and the bottom displays a series of touch-screen controls, including record, stop and play. Consumers can even rotate the swivel lens to utilize this screen to put themselves in the frame, allowing them to step out from behind the camcorder and become part of the action. When reviewing footage, consumers hold the HMX-E10 horizontally, so that they can leverage the entire display to view their video in widescreen.<br /><br />Creative Controls<br />The HMX-E10 is packed with a full range of fun controls which encourage consumers to get creative with their videos. Consumers can take advantage of several Smart Filters which adjust the HMX-E10 to produce unique lens and color effects. The camcorder’s lens effects include miniature, which produces the tilt and lens shift effect, and vignetting, which produces the lomo effect. Color effects include defog, which mimics the use of a CPL filter, and sketch, which gives video a pencil drawing feel.<br /><br />Pricing    $199.99<br /><br />* Specifications and design are subject to change without notice.<br /><br />For additional information regarding Samsung’s 2010 digital imaging product lineup, including press releases, video content and product images, please visit www.samsung.com/newsroom.<br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd<br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

				<![CDATA[
					Ridgefield Park, NJ & Raleigh, NC, July 29, 2010 — Samsung Electronics America Inc. ., a market leader and award-winning innovator in consumer electronics, and TeleHealth Services, the nation’s leading provider of healthcare grade televisions and interactive patient education systems, today announced the availability of two new UL-approved LCD TVs designed specifically for hospitals.  The new line of healthcare televisions, the Samsung LCD 458 Series, integrates hospital-specific features to provide education and entertainment solutions that optimize operational efficiency, promote patient satisfaction and improve sustainability.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Patients expect more from healthcare facilities and increasingly want access to modern conveniences when they are away from home. Samsung is excited to partner with TeleHealth Services to deliver solutions that help hospitals enhance the patient experience,” said Jonas Tanenbaum, vice president of LCD HDTV marketing at Samsung Electronics America Inc. “These new products demonstrate our continued commitment to bringing premium entertainment experiences to consumers no matter where they are.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />“As the leading provider of patient education and entertainment solutions for the healthcare market, we are proud to be partnering with Samsung to provide this cutting edge technology to make the patient experience more enjoyable,” said<br /><br />George Fleming, president and CEO of TeleHealth Services.   “This is an exciting time for healthcare technology as these new healthcare LCD models combine the best entertainment features with the latest in healthcare television technology. TeleHealth Services is proud to be Samsung’s partner as we provide hospitals with the ultimate patient television experience.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Superior Entertainment Experience Without Compromise<br /><br />Samsung and TeleHealth Services have partnered to bring the comfort of an at-home entertainment experience into hospitals with these new LCD TVs, available in 26 inches and 32 inches. Featuring a full HD display with Wide Color Enhancer technology, the new models deliver superior picture quality through sharp, detailed images and smooth motion. The LCD TVs also include Dolby Digital Plus and bottom firing speakers to extend the HD excitement beyond the screen.<br /><br /> <br /><br />One of the main features of the new LCD TVs is the integration of TeleHealth Services’ proprietary TIGR patient education system, which makes an entire library of educational videos available on-demand in hospital rooms. Educational programs can be accessed at any time, day or night directly from the patient’s bedside using a hospital’s telephone system. In addition, both models offer USB autosensing side inputs and an interchangeable pillow speaker interface. The USB autosensing side inputs enable patients to easily access content, such as music, movies, videos, games and more by allowing patients to connect external entertainment devices to the television via a USB port. Hospitals benefit from the interchangeable pillow speaker interface that enables inter-compatibility between multiple pillow speaker brands and pin sets.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Outstanding Operational Efficiency<br /><br />The Samsung line of healthcare LCD TVs, featuring technology from TeleHealth Services, offers a number of key features that improve operational efficiency.  The new line of healthcare LCD TVs is UL-listed for hospital use and meets the more stringent requirements for use in hospital environments.  To assist in the ease of installation, the Samsung healthcare LCD TVs also feature USB cloning technology, making it easy for administrators to quickly customize and deploy the sets across the facility.

				<![CDATA[
					RIDGEFIELD PARK, NJ, August 11, 2010 – Samsung Electronics America, Inc., a market leader and award-winning innovator in consumer electronics, today kicks off its Free the TV Challenge to find the most innovative applications for IPTVs, Blu-ray players and Blu-ray Home Theater Systems. . With a total prize value of half a million dollars, the Challenge is open to all developers in the US starting today.   <br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung also announced that the number of applications available through Samsung Apps, the world’s first HDTV-based application store, has more than doubled since its launch five months ago. Beginning today, people can choose from a wide range of unique and premium apps across five categories – video, gaming, social media, sports and kids – including apps from ESPN and Hulu which are currently exclusive to Samsung. They can also download and enjoy the world’s first 3D video on-demand app to view trailers of 3D movies.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“We are thrilled that content owners continue to embrace Samsung Apps and that we have doubled the number of applications available to owners of Samsung 2010 connected TVs and Blu-ray devices,” said Eric Anderson, vice president of content and product solutions, Samsung Electronics America, Inc. “The Free the TV Challenge will continue that momentum by opening up these TVs to even more developers across the US who want to distribute their content on the biggest screen in the home. People want a connected entertainment experience with their devices and we encourage developers to free the TV by bringing new concepts, as well as existing apps from many platforms, to the TV.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Free the TV Challenge Opens Today<br /><br />With the Free the TV Challenge, Samsung is unlocking a new era in smart TV by helping free the TV for developers, who can now tap into the expanding market for TV applications. Developers can go to www.FreeTheTVChallenge.com to register for the contest, starting today.  To be eligible, developers must live in the United States, submit the final app and provide a video that showcases how the app works to Samsung by November 11, 2010. The contest will be administered by New York-based startup ChallengePost, and entries will be judged based on the quality of the idea, functional implementation, and visual appeal. Total prize value is US$500,000. Roelof Botha from Sequoia, Mike Maples from Floodgate, Bob Borchers from Opus Capital and Jeremy Levine from Bessemer will serve as judges. Consumers will also have an opportunity to cast their vote online for the “People’s Choice Award.” Samsung will announce the overall winner at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, NV. <br /><br /> <br /><br />In addition, select applications submitted to the Free the TV Challenge will be made available to the large and growing community of Samsung Apps users. Samsung Apps is accessible on all 2010 Samsung Blu-ray players, Blu-ray Home Theater Systems and the majority of HDTVs with screen sizes 40” or larger.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Built with the developer in mind, Samsung Apps supports common web standards, like Javascript, XML and support for Adobe Flash Lite 3.1, and uses a single SDK for apps that runs across HDTVs, Blu-ray players and Blu-ray Home Theater systems. This eliminates many of the barriers to development by allowing applications to be written once and deployed across several platforms, ultimately enabling more versatile monetization for developers and a consistent, intuitive experience for consumers.<br /><br /> <br /><br />To further support developers, Samsung is launching a series of Free the TV Developer Days, where developers will get hands-on demonstrations of the Samsung Apps platform and a tutorial on the Samsung SDK, as well as participate in a Q&A session with Samsung engineers.  The first session will be held on August 31, 2010 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, CA, and Pandora Founder Tim Westergren will speak at the event.   <br /><br /> <br /><br />More information on Samsung’s Developer Days and registration for the Free the TV Challenge is available at www.FreeTheTVChallenge.com.<br /><br /> <br /><br />New Apps Demonstrate Diversity of Content and Services  <br /><br />Samsung continues to see explosive growth in smart TV and has more than doubled the number of available applications in its library within five months. In addition to various free apps, Samsung today expanded its library of apps with the addition of ESPN’s Next Level application, as well as a variety of other premium apps that offer a variety of 3D, sports, casual gaming, weather and family-oriented content at the touch of a button.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The new ESPN Next Level app, available as a free download exclusively through Samsung Apps, is expected to be a hit with sports fans. With four main sections, the app will allow fans to access in-depth looks at sports events and players in the news; predictive picks of the day's games across all major sports; research nuggets from the ESPN Research team; and insights from Peter Keating, Senior Writer at ESPN The Magazine, who gives his unique perspective on a variety of statistical subjects.  Samsung and ESPN plan to introduce a ScoreCenter app in the Fall of 2010, based on the popular app currently available on mobile devices.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung will soon launch the world’s first 3D Video On-Demand app which offers viewers sneak previews of upcoming 3D movies. All apps are available from today and can be downloaded directly on the TV via their Internet-connected HDTV, Blu-ray player or Blu-ray Home Theater System*.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung, the market leader in smart TV, is committed to expanding the types of experiences available to consumers.  In 2008, the company was the first to deliver text-based RSS feeds, bringing news, weather and stock information directly to the TV with its InfoLink feature.  In 2009, Samsung added Yahoo! widgets to the smart TV experience, as well as streaming video services with providers like Blockbuster and Amazon video-on-demand.  With the launch of Samsung Apps this year, Samsung is broadening the smart TV experience, bringing services such as text-based information, casual games, sports, communications, social and location services, and HD and 3D video to consumers.  The addition of these new premium apps underscores momentum around the platform as leading content providers continue to recognize the platform’s flexibility in delivering the growing types of content that meet consumers’ demand. Today, more than 60 industry-leading partners have made personalized, easy to use smart TV experiences available to consumers through Samsung Apps, including exclusive HDTV-based apps content from ESPN and Hulu Plus, among other leading brands like Blockbuster, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Pandora, Twitter, USA TODAY and Vudu.<br /><br /> <br /><br />For more information about Samsung Apps, please visit, http://www.samsung.com/newsroom.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics America, Inc.<br />Headquartered in Ridgefield Park, NJ, Samsung Electronics America, Inc.

				<![CDATA[
					RIDGEFIELD PARK, NJ, August 25, 2010 – Samsung Electronics America, Inc., a market leader and award-winning innovator in consumer electronics, today announced the lineup of speakers for its upcoming Free the TV Developer Day, to be held on August 31 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, CA. The speakers represent diverse interests across the connected TV ecosystem – content services, retail and technology – and underscore the deep industry support committed to driving the growth and potential of smart TVs.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Industry luminaries speaking at the event include:<br /><br />·         Boo-Keun Yoon, President, Samsung Electronics<br /><br />·         Steve Wozniak, Silicon Valley icon, inventor and philanthropist<br /><br />·         Tim Westergren, Founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Pandora<br /><br />·         Robert Stephens, Chief Technology Officer, Best Buy and founder of Geek Squad<br /><br />·         Chuck Pagano,  Executive Vice President of Technology, ESPN<br /><br />·         Brian Cooley, Editor-at-Large, CNET<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Free the TV Developer Day is a core element of Samsung’s applications contest titled the Free the TV Challenge, which was launched on August 11, 2010. It seeks to help developers better understand Samsung’s smart TV platform and the ever expanding market potential for TV applications.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung’s Free the TV Challenge is part of the company’s growing global commitment to galvanize developers around the world to design and create innovative smart TV apps. Samsung launched a similar challenge in Korea earlier this year, and will launch the third phase of the global challenge later this year in Europe. The US Challenge offers a prize value of half a million dollars. Successful developers that are able to create innovative TV apps based on the Samsung Apps platform also have the opportunity to reach audiences in about 120 countries, where the service has been introduced via Samsung Apps, the world's first HDTV-based application store.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“TV viewing is evolving from a singular, passive experience into a rich, interactive experience with the largest screen in the home,” said Tim Baxter, President of Samsung Electronics America. “As the pioneer in smart TVs, we want to encourage developers to free the TV by bringing new concepts, as well as existing apps from many platforms, to the TV. We’re thrilled that others in the industry share our vision and look forward to the start of a new TV evolution.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung Apps was built with the developer in mind and supports common web standards, like Javascript, XML and support for Adobe Flash Lite 3.1. It uses a single SDK for apps that runs across HDTVs, Blu-ray players and Blu-ray Home Theater systems and eliminates many of the development barriers by allowing applications to be written once and deployed across several platforms.  This ultimately enables more versatile monetization for developers and a consistent, intuitive experience for consumers.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Interested parties can go to www.FreeTheTVChallenge.com to get more information on and register for the Free the TV Developer Day and Samsung’s Free the TV Challenge.<br /><br /> <br /><br />For more information about Samsung, including press releases, video content and product images, please visit: http://www.samsung.com/newsroom.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics America, Inc.<br />Headquartered in Ridgefield Park, NJ, Samsung Electronics America, Inc.

					SAN JOSE, CA, August 31, 2010 – Today, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. brings a global effort to the U.S. to help developers, content providers and application enthusiasts join the Smart TV era, and transform the viewing experience at home.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung is holding its first Free the TV Developer Day in the U. .S. for Samsung TVs at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, bringing together notable leaders across the connected TV ecosystem – content, retail and technology – and underscoring the deep industry support committed to driving the growth and potential of smart TVs.  The roster of speakers include Silicon Valley icon Steve Wozniak, Pandora Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Tim Westergren, ESPN Chief Technology Officer Chuck Pagano, Best Buy Chief Technology Officer and found of Geek Squad Robert Stephens, and CNET Editor-at-Large Brian Cooley. They will be joined by Mr. Boo-keun Yoon, President of Samsung’s Visual Display Business Unit.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung has created a new category of TVs – Smart TV– that not only delivers personalization and customization to the TV viewing experience, but also content discovery and distribution service to the home. Samsung  organized the Free the TV Developer Day to help developers better understand its Smart TV platform, called Samsung Apps, and the ever expanding market opportunities for TV applications. This gathering is a core element of Samsung’s Free the TV Challenge apps contest (www.FreeTheTVChallenge.com) which launched on August 11 and will award half a million dollars in prizes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“2010 is a momentous year for the television industry and for transforming the viewing experience of people worldwide,” says Mr. Yoon. “To vitalize the Smart TV market, it is crucial to provide quality local content tailored to consumers of different countries. We are expanding the Samsung Apps Contest from Korea to the US and Europe and will work hard to create an environment where developers, consumers and Samsung win together.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Activation of Samsung Apps on Samsung TV and Blu-ray products is now over 50 percent.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Music is a part of everyday life, and so is connectivity. The Samsung Apps platform makes it easy for Samsung TV owners to turn on Pandora and enjoy access to free personalized radio,” said Mr. Westergren. “Samsung is not only changing the face of TV, but also helping evolve the direction of the music industry by giving consumers a new gateway to access their favorite songs.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />“By making information available at the click of the remote, Samsung apps help us engage our fans in a whole new way,” said Mr. Pagano. “With the Samsung ESPN Next Level app, the information a sports fan craves can be accessed in one easy package. It also allows us to serve our fans directly on the screen that represents the core of our business and the best for sports viewing.  It’s a win-win for all involved.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Free the TV Challenge is part of a global rollout of developer-focused contests and events led by Samsung around the globe that open up TVs to developers wanting to distribute their content on the biggest screen in the home and on an easy-to-use platform.<br /><br /> <br /><br />During Free the TV Developer Day, developers will learn more about the SDK and how to enter Samsung’s Free the TV Challenge to create the most innovative applications based on the Samsung Apps platform. Developers entering the challenge are eligible for the winning prize valued at half a million dollars and also have the opportunity to reach audiences in about 120 countries, where the service has been introduced.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung launched a similar challenge in Korea earlier this year, and will launch the third phase of the global challenge later this year in Europe. From the challenge in Korea, a multi-language Fairy Tale Book was built to enable viewers to enjoy fairy tale books in various languages via the TV. A TV karaoke application was also created as part of the contest.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Built with the developer in mind, Samsung Apps supports common web standards, like Javascript, XML and support for Adobe Flash Lite 3.1, and uses a single SDK for apps that runs across HDTVs, Blu-ray players and Blu-ray Home Theater systems. This eliminates many of the barriers to development by allowing applications to be written once and deployed across several platforms, ultimately enabling more versatile monetization for developers and a consistent, intuitive experience for consumers.<br /><br /> <br /><br />More information on the Free the TV Challenge is available at www.FreeTheTVChallenge.com.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Upon judging completion, consumers will have the opportunity to cast their vote online for the “People’s Choice Award.”  An overall winner will be announced at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.<br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.<br /><br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2008 consolidated sales of US$96 billion. Employing approximately 164,600 people in 179 offices across 61 countries, the company consists of seven independently operated business units: Visual Display, Mobile Communications, Telecommunication Systems, Digital Appliances, IT Solutions, Semiconductor and LCD. Recognized as one of the fastest growing global brands, Samsung Electronics is a leading producer of digital TVs, memory chips, mobile phones and TFT-LCDs.

			<title>Product News : Samsung Monitors Receive Vmware Ready 4.5™ Certification for Groundbreaking PC-Over-IP® Monitors</title>

					RIDGEFIELD PARK, N.J., September 1, 2010 – Samsung Electronics America Inc., a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Corporation, announced at VMware World that its NC190 and NC240 monitors are now VMWare 4.5 certified.  The integrated PCoIP monitors allow secure access to remote servers and data centers, and this new certification supports Common Access Card (CAC) technologies which are mandatory for United States government agencies. The NC190 and NC240, 19” and 23.6” zero-client displays provide an alternative to desktop PCs, enabling highly secure access to any PC-over-IP (PCoIP®)-enabled remote host. Users can connect to centralized servers, without the need for individual workstations at desks.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Samsung’s NC190 and NC240 were among the first VMware Ready™ Certified PCoIP monitors on the market earlier this year and with the release of VMWare 4.5 certification they bring a more efficient experience for end-users,” said Young Bae, director of display at Samsung Electronics Enterprise Business Division. “Adopting this technology allows government, healthcare, and any other end-user with highly sensitive information to control, the ability to access information on remote hosts, manages version control when file-sharing, and keep work spaces clutter free.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Samsung is a valuable member of the VMware partner ecosystem, helping proliferate PCoIP® as part of its zero-client offerings to deliver a rich end-user experience while reducing management costs for IT organizations,” said Patrick Harr, vice president, desktop virtualization, VMware. “By receiving VMWare 4.5 certification on the NC190 and NC240 monitors, Samsung has further demonstrated its investment in providing secure, remote virtual computing in a corporate environment.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Uncompromised user experience<br />The Samsung NC190 and NC240 contain a range of features providing an impressive user experience. They each offer a high definition picture ideal for CAD/CAM, graphic design and 3D rendering environments. Additional features designed to support user experience are the inclusion of four USB ports for easily added peripherals, a compact design maximizing desktop space, HD-ready video viewing and ultra fast response rates.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Exceptional security<br />Data is highly secure in the NC190 / NC240 environment. No data leaves the remote host or datacenter, ensuring that individual workstations cannot be hacked or infected with viruses or spyware. All images transmitted to the displays are encrypted, providing a highly secure connection. With VMWare4.5 certification, the monitors support CAC technology, particularly important for government organizations.<br /><br /><br />Additionally, USB authentication ensures that no unauthorized devices can be attached to the system. This makes them ideal for use in environments such as finance, government and military.<br /><br /> <br /><br />True zero-client<br />The Samsung NC190 and NC240 are true zero-client displays, allowing connections direct from the desktop display to a central host. The fanless screens contain no OS, drivers or hard drives. They provide a low-power alternative to traditional desktop computers while integrating seamlessly into existing systems which use PCoIP®-enabled rack workstations, towers or blade PCs. This reduces maintenance costs as all software installed on the server automatically extends to each user’s desktop.<br /><br /><br />The Samsung NC190 and NC240 are available now with a MSRP of $698 and $815, respectively. Both monitors are available through Samsung resellers and distribution channels, which can be located by calling 1-800-SAMSUNG or by visiting www.samsung.com.<br /><br /> <br /><br />About Samsung Electronics America Enterprise Business Division<br />Based in Ridgefield Park, N.J., Samsung’s Enterprise Business Division (EBD) is a division of Samsung Electronics America (SEA), a U.S. subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.

The new QX410, SF510, RF510 and RF710 laptops and the NF series netbooks showcase Samsung’s continued dedication to innovation in mobile computing, and set a new standard for premium and functional design at any price point.<br /> <br /><br />“Samsung continues to evolve our mobile PC line-up creating a sleeker, more stylish and technologically superior product perfect for professionals, students, or multimedia-focused consumers,” said Todd Bouman, director of product marketing at Samsung Enterprise Business Division.  “More importantly, the technological innovations within the QX, SF, RF and NF series of mobile PCs underscore Samsung’s position as a leader in mobile computing, offering consumers the performance they’ve come to expect in an aesthetically pleasing package.”<br /><br />QX410: Superior Design, Unbeatable Performance<br />At just under one inch in thickness, Samsung’s new QX410 laptop combines a light-weight ultra-chic aluminum design and unparalleled battery performance to create an elegantly streamlined and efficient computing machine. <br /> <br /><br />Centered on Samsung’s hallmark edge-to-edge 14-inch HD SuperBright™ LED display, the QX410 integrates an all-new buttonless, easily configurable multi-function gesture pad, introducing users to a host of multi-finger interface commands while increasing accuracy and speed.<br /> <br /><br />Additionally, the QX410 is powered by a state-of-the-art Intel® CoreTM i5 processor.  Further complementing the QX410’s performance is a hybrid graphics system, optimized on-the-go based on users’ needs.  NVIDIA® OptimusTM automatically switches between the onboard Intel graphics and NVIDIA discrete graphics to efficiently manage battery life for basic applications, also delivering high-quality performance for intensive activities like gaming and multimedia on-demand.<br /> <br /><br />The QX410 makes use of Samsung’s new lithium polymer batteries, which achieve up to 7 hours of battery life on average.  Lithium polymer batteries extend the life of the product with double the lifespan for up to 3 years or 1,000 charging cycles.<br /><br /> <br /><br />RF510 and RF710: Premium Performance Powerhouses<br />The RF510 and RF710 laptops emphasize extreme performance, while maintaining a sleek and refined style.   They are accentuated by a distinctive black radial pattern on the display enclosure and a two-tone interior design.  <br /> <br /><br />Powered by either an Intel® CoreTM i5 or i7 processor with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology, the RF510 and RF710 take aim at gamers, multimedia aficionados and design buffs offering extreme computing power.

With these applications in mind, the RF710 notebook features two hard drive bays making the laptop capable of carrying over 1TB of storage allowing users to house their entire media library on their laptop.  The RF series also introduces USB 3.0 to Samsung’s laptop line-up.<br /> <br /><br />SuperBright™ LED displays enhance the experience with HD+ (1600x900) resolution in the RF710 and HD (1366 x 768) resolution in the RF510, making them the ultimate choice for multimedia applications.

Standard in the RF710, a Blu-ray drive allows users to watch their favorite HD movies on Samsung’s incredible SuperBright LED backlit display.<br /><br /> <br /><br />SF510: Sleek, Simple and Sophisticated<br />Integrating a uniquely contoured clamshell design, the new SF510 is hip and sophisticated without sacrificing computing power or functionality. Gently cradling the ultra-sharp 15.6-inch SuperBright HD LED backlit display in an ivory exterior and chocolate interior design, the SF510 features fluid and ergonomic design.  Moreover, it conveniently places control in the user’s hands, with the multi-touch gesture pad and easily identifiable quick-access buttons for volume and WiFi for simple, intuitive operation.<br /> <br /><br />The SF510 is powered by an Intel® CoreTM i3 processor and like the QX series, capitalizes on Samsung’s new lithium polymer batteries offering up to 7 hours of battery life for users.  The SF510, with its ultra portable, stylish design and powerful performance, makes anytime, anywhere mobile computing a practical and affordable reality.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Enhanced Usability and Connectivity<br />The QX, SF, and RF laptops can communicate with other Samsung devices with Easy File Share,  a simple  to use peer-to-peer networking feature that allows users to quickly and securely exchange files, images, movies, and music wirelessly with any other laptop, netbook or wireless-enabled PC.  Samsung’s AllShareTM technology features an intuitive interface that makes it easy to broadcast content over a user’s WiFi network to Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) enabled devices like HDTVs and even mobile phones.  <br /> <br /><br />Samsung’s Support Center ensures all this content can stay safe, or can help troubleshoot any particular problem.  Accessible with a keyboard shortcut, the Support Center helps users manage their system settings or can setup tech-support web chat.  Samsung’s Back-up & Recovery Solution also allows users to create and restore back-ups of system data on the device, or on a network or removable storage device.<br /> <br /><br />Also enhancing usability is Samsung’s Fast Start feature, which easily allows the user to put their laptop or netbook in an advanced state of sleep, to reduce power consumption while the device is not in use. The user’s session can then be restored in as little as 3 seconds.<br /> <br /><br />To help improve the laptop audio experience, the new QX, RF and SF series laptops feature Samsung’s new True2SoundTM audio system, which delivers a more natural and realistic auditory experience with round speakers and a bigger acoustic chamber.  Enhanced bass, crystal clear dialog and better definition control for maximum clarity is provided through SRS Premium Sound™ processing.<br /> <br /><br />Lastly, focusing on convenience and connectivity, the new laptops boast built-in WiMax in the SF and QX series, and utilize the latest in Wi-Fi and USB Sleep & Charge technologies.  <br /><br /> <br /><br />NF Series: Ultra Light, Ultra Portable, Ultra Capable<br />Taking a style cue from the SF-series laptops, the NF Series netbooks provide users with an ultra-portable solution to mobile computing.

			<title>Product News : Samsung Sets Sights on Industry Leadership with Pioneering Nx100</title>

				<![CDATA[
					Ridgefield Park, NJ (September 14, 2010) – Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technologies, today announced the launch of the unique Samsung NX100 – an innovative mirrorless camera equipped with the world’s first i-Function lens, putting the perfect picture at the fingertips of all photographers through a completely new way of controlling your camera.<br /><br />The NX100 is expected to dominate the new mirrorless camera category. The innovative NX100 has benefited from Samsung’s expertise across multiple areas of technology as all of the camera’s key components are produced internally. Samsung’s expertise has been combined with a detailed and extensive program of consumer research, which provided valuable insights that the company’s designers and engineers have incorporated into the creation of the NX100. Additionally, the unparalleled camera is complemented by an extensive line up of lenses and accessories, which give photographers the full package to explore their creativity.<br /><br />The launch of the NX100 follows the success of the NX10, Samsung’s first mirrorless camera and the first in the world to feature an APS-C size sensor, which has changed the way photographers across the globe take pictures, and raised the bar for the industry as a whole. The NX100 shares the industry leading technology of NX10, such as an APS-C size sensor for quality images and a 3-inch AMOLED screen for easy and clear viewing. However, with the NX100, Samsung takes the mirrorless camera to the next level, by incorporating the innovations of the NX10 and improving other areas of the camera’s performance and design. While the body of the camera is slim, sleek, and stylish, the NX100 also features the intuitive i-Function lens which allows users to control their camera through the lens for the first time. The NX100 also boasts one of the fastest AF on the market today, which ensures that users never miss a moment, and an ISO that is raised to a maximum of 6400 for action shots.<br /><br />The design of the NX100 is inspired by the simple shape of dew forming on a leaf, which can be seen on the camera’s shutter button and curved body, which comes in two different colors; black and brown. The lightweight, compact and modern design makes the camera portable, allowing users with a creative flair to carry the NX100 with them anywhere and for any occasion. The NX100 is more than just a camera; it is both a creative tool and an artistic object that makes a bold style statement everywhere it goes.<br /><br />“Our aim is to dominate the mirrorless camera market in the same way that we do in the DualView category, and the new NX100 is the embodiment of that goal,” said Mr. SangJin Park, President of Samsung Digital Imaging Division, Samsung Electronics. “We are the first to create a mirrorless camera with high quality imaging technology which has been designed based on intuitive consumer insights from our in-depth consumer research. This is why we believe that the NX100, alongside the NX10, will cement our leadership in this growing field. Our unique and pioneering i-Function Lens stands out from the competition as an example of our unparalleled innovation, which will appeal to every photographer.”<br /><br />While conventional lenses were passive in controlling camera settings, the unique i-Function Lens is a proactive lens that communicates with the camera body. It delivers total image control with fast manual settings to ensure quick and easy image capturing, and also provides customized settings which are ideal for the lens being used. The lens incorporates a conveniently-located i-Function button which allows users to scroll through manual settings, and a focus ring which is used to easily change parameters for each setting. This unprecedented control system is clever, intuitive and fast, putting the perfect picture at everyone’s fingertips.<br /><br />Since a typical camera-user wraps their hand around the lens when holding the camera, the new system means that photographers can naturally use their left hand to change settings through the intuitive i-Function lens without the need to take the cameras off the target. Users can toggle between shutter speed, aperture, EV, WB, and ISO quickly and easily by simply using the i-Function button and ring on the lens, meaning easier and quicker configuration while shooting.<br /><br />The NX100 also has a lens priority mode which makes switching between lenses easier than ever. Each lens is clearly marked with icons that illustrate their main usages, so beginners can quickly understand which lens they need to select for any given scene. The lens priority mode provides scene options specifically designed for the lens being used – for example when a landscape lens is attached, the camera will immediately display the landscape mode. Additionally, when users change to a specialized lens, the camera will recognize the lens type and automatically configure the settings that would best match with the attached lens. This latter feature will work with future, specialized Samsung lenses.<br /><br />The NX100’s innovations aren’t confined to the lens – the camera also provides a very creative feature called ‘Smart Filter’. In playback mode, users can apply seven different effects to the picture, such as the vignette, soft focus, fish-eye, or miniature effects. The ‘Smart Filter’ provides not just high quality images, but also features that are fun to use.<br /><br />The fun doesn't stop with the still image options - the NX100 supports HD movie recording at 720P, so that memories can stay alive in their finest details. The NX100 also contains a ‘Sound Picture’ mode, which can record audio when a photo is taken enriching the experience. To ensure the perfect quality of every image, even when lenses are being regularly changed, the NX100 also features a supersonic dust reduction feature to remove foreign particles from the lens before shooting.<br /><br />The NX100 will be equipped with a range of innovative lenses and accessories to further enhance the user’s experience. At launch, the lens line-up includes a compact zoom 20-50mm lens to provide both high image quality and portability. A small and light 20mm wide angle Pancake lens will be introduced shortly after. Two additional specialized lenses will be available in the first half of 2011 – a 60mm Macro lens and 18-200mm Super Zoom lens. To expand the lens line-up even further, three more lenses will be introduced by the second half of 2011, including 16mm, 85mm, and 16-80mm lenses. The NX system will be further enhanced with more accessories, including an Electronic Viewfinder, Flash and GPS tracker to capture your exact geographical location.<br /><br />Specifications<br /><br />NX100<br />Image sensor: 14.6 Mega-pixels APS-C size CMOS sensor<br />Useable lens: Samsung Lenses<br />Display: 3.0" VGA AMOLED Display<br />ISO Equivalent: Auto, 100 - 3200, Extension settable : ISO 6400<br />Shooting modes: SmartAuto, Lens Priority, Program, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Manual, Scene, Movie<br />Scene mode: Beauty shot, Children, Close Up, Text, Sunset, Dawn, Backlight, Fireworks, Beach & Snow, Night, Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Sound Picture<br />Movie recording: 720P HD Movie Recording (H.264)<br />Storage media: SD, SDHC (Up to 32GB)<br />EVF: Optional<br />GPS: Geo-tagging w/ Optional GPS Module (GPS10)<br />Battery life: Still : 420shot , 210min (CIPA Standard) Movie : 130min<br />Dimensions: 120.5 x 71 x 34.5mm (excluding the projection part)<br />Weight: 282g  (without battery and Memory card)<br /><br />SAMSUNG Standard Zoom Lens (20-50mm F3.5-5.6 ED)<br />Focal Length: 20 - 50mm (equivalent to 30.8-77mm in 35mm format)<br />Elements in Groups: 9 elements in 8 groups (1 Aspherical lens, 1 Extra-low Dispersion lens)<br />Aperture: F3.5 - 5.6 (Min.

					Samsung and its partners today called on teachers across the United States to submit their application for a chance to participate in Samsung’s Solve for Tomorrow video competition. The program will reward the schools of winning teachers and students with a variety of Samsung electronics, Microsoft and Adobe software, and DIRECTV educational programming valued at over $1 million.  As part of Samsung’s Hope for Children initiative, this concerted effort will promote math and science education as a path to fostering sustainable innovation.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Samsung has achieved unprecedented success this year and recognizes the importance of leveraging these accomplishments to encourage U. .S. students to pursue studies and careers related to STEM – Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math,” said David Steel, EVP of Strategy and Corporate Communications, Samsung Electronics America. “It is our goal to educate students and teachers on the importance of STEM, while providing them with the resources necessary to advance technology in schools and sustainable innovation in their communities. Samsung’s Solve for Tomorrow allows us to take an active role to move closer toward this goal that is critically important to America’s future.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />As a global technology leader, Samsung is committing its design and innovation leadership to address a critical education issue in the U.S.: student underperformance in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM).  STEM education has recently become a national priority, as it has become increasingly apparent that U.S. students are not advancing in these subjects at the same pace as in other countries. To raise enthusiasm for STEM studies and to address the technology gap in classrooms, Samsung is asking 6th-12th grade teachers and their students to produce creative videos that explore the question: “How can science or math help improve the environment in your community?”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Through October 24th, teachers can submit a short application for a chance to participate in the video contest.  Fifty selected classrooms will receive a Samsung camcorder and laptop, along with Adobe® Premiere® Elements and Photoshop® Elements software to create videos responding to the question.  To learn more about the contest or submit an application, visit: samsung.com/solvefortomorrow<br /><br /> <br /><br />“To compete in a global economy, youth need more skills than ever,” said Michelle Mann, executive director of the Adobe Foundation. “Our Adobe Youth Voices global philanthropy program is dedicated to improving education and igniting student enthusiasm for learning. By teaming up with the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow program, we have the opportunity to inspire young people’s interest in STEM-based education, by providing technology and experiences that will build valuable skills for future success.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />In addition, Samsung is proud to continue its ongoing relationships with existing partners Microsoft and DirecTV who share the same passion for supporting education.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Microsoft is dedicated and committed to public service and supporting children’s education,” said Sig Behrens, General Manager of US Education for Microsoft. “In partnering with Samsung’s Hope for Children program over the past five years, we have had an incredible opportunity to continue to contribute to the education of our children and our communities. The importance of providing schools with the advance technology available today is not only helpful for improving their education but also sustaining the future.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />“Samsung’s Solve for Tomorrow brings several very important issues to light – from science and math education to sustainability,” said Caroline Leach, vice president of Communications for DIRECTV. “DIRECTV considers advancing K-12 education a high priority, which we support with our education-focused programming package and other initiatives, and partnering with Samsung will provide a great impact both in and out of the classroom.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />Samsung is also partnering with the National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF), a nonpartisan, non-advocacy organization that advances lifelong environmental learning. Through its programming, NEEF raises awareness of the importance of environmental education, improving educational opportunities and connecting community resources. NEEF is a leading authority on environmental education and, in working with Samsung, will aim to help Solve for Tomorrow to create a measurable impact on children’s ability to utilize STEM to solve practical environmental problems.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“NEEF is committed to giving students the tools they need to solve problems in their communities and generate lasting positive change,” said Diane Wood, President of the National Environmental Education Foundation. “Fostering an interest in STEM education by building on an existing passion for the environment is a win-win; students find solutions for issues in their communities while becoming interested in STEM subjects. We’re proud to partner with Samsung on this innovative program.” <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />No purchase necessary to enter or win in the Samsung “Solve for Tomorrow” Education Contest. Open to legal residents of the 50 US & DC, 21 or older & currently employed as a public school teacher, grades 6-12. Void where prohibited. Contest begins 9/13/10, ends 2/25/11. For Official Rules and judging criteria, go to www.samsung.com/solvefortomorrow. Sponsor: Samsung Electronics America, Inc.

Fans of the band will not have to wait long, since Samsung is releasing the teaser video trailer today for all avid OK Go fans. <br /><br />The trailer introduces the collaborative creative project between OK Go and the NX100, with an entertaining first glimpse of what is to come.

Samsung’s partnership with OK Go combines the band’s inventive and creative approach with the ability of the NX100 to produce new and exciting creative moments.<br /><br />A series of behind-the-scenes episodes has also been produced using the Samsung NX100, following OK Go as they embark on this creative project.

					Ridgefield Park, NJ (October 11, 2010) – Samsung Electronics. Co. Ltd, a global leader in digital media and digital convergence technology, today announced a firmware upgrade for its NX10 mirrorless camera that will ensure compatibility with Samsung’s innovative new i-Function lens technology, putting the perfect picture at the fingertips of all photographers through an exceptionally easy way of controlling the camera. The new firmware for the NX10 is version 1.20.<br /><br />Users of the NX10 camera will now have the power to control the camera’s settings conveniently and intuitively from the lens itself, something not possible on other camera lines. While conventional lenses are passive in controlling camera settings, the unique i-Function Lens is a proactive lens that communicates with the camera body. The NX10 will now also deliver total image control with a remarkably easy way to control camera settings to ensure quick image capturing, and also provide customized settings optimized for the lens being used.<br /><br />To guarantee photographers capture their perfect picture and engage with their shots, all NX system lenses launched from now on will feature the i-Function capability, which is a convenient one-touch button that activates common shooting controls like aperture, shutter speed, ISO and white balance, meaning easier and quicker configuration while shooting. When the button is pressed, the shooting parameter is shown on screen with a graphical cue and rotating the manual focus ring on the lens changes the value. The firmware upgrade also provides a faster AF speed on the camera, which ensures that users never miss that perfect moment.<br /><br />The NX system firmware upgrade provides compatibility with a range of innovative lenses and accessories to further enhance the user’s experience. The lens line-up available to NX10 users will also include a compact zoom 20-50mm lens to provide both high image quality and portability and a small and light 20mm wide angle Pancake lens, with the updated Graphic User Interface (GUI) to support the i-Function lens technology. The enhanced lens capability will include Lens Distortion Compensation (LDC) to ensure reduced image distortion across the NX model range for all camera users.<br /><br />Additionally, the GPS tracker enables photographers to capture their exact geographical location in real time. The models will provide camera users with the ability to geotag their special picture moments when capturing images with the GPS tracker, specifically tagging the coordinates and city name. The city names can be displayed across 76 countries and the display capability includes the name of the city directly on the screen, which means that users can now sort their images by location.<br /><br />“We want to ensure that all NX system range users can experience the same pioneering technology,” said Mr. SangJin Park, President of Samsung Digital Imaging Business, Samsung Electronics. “All NX system lenses launched from now on will feature the groundbreaking i-Function capability, so all our customers have the perfect picture at their fingertips. Our unique i-Function Lens technology is the first of its kind and is another example of our unparalleled innovation which will appeal to every photographer – whether they are a beginner or an enthusiast.”<br /><br />More information on the firmware is available at:<br />http://www.samsung.com<br /><br />About Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd<br />Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is a global leader in semiconductor, telecommunication, digital media and digital convergence technologies with 2009 consolidated sales of US$116.8 billion.

					DALLAS, September 16, 2010 —Samsung Telecommunications America (Samsung Mobile)1, the No. 1 mobile phone provider in the U.S., today announced the upcoming availability of the Galaxy Tab™ in the U.S with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. The first mobile tablet from Samsung shares many of the powerful characteristics of the Galaxy S smart phone lineup that launched this summer. The Galaxy Tab is designed with several enhancements to create a unique mobile experience that other products can’t deliver.<br /><br />The Galaxy Tab features a brilliant 7-inch enhanced TFT display screen, 1GHz Hummingbird Application processor supporting 3D graphics and smooth Web browsing and front and rear-facing cameras for video chat while on-the-go. . The Galaxy Tab is powered by Android 2.2™, including full support for Adobe® Flash® Player 10.1. Just like the Galaxy S smart phones, the Galaxy Tab includes Samsung’s Social Hub application and the new Media Hub content service, offering a robust collection of premium movies and TV episodes from some of the biggest entertainment companies.<br /><br />“The addition of Galaxy Tab to the Galaxy product portfolio is a powerful proof point of Samsung’s commitment to bring new and innovative mobile experiences to U.S. consumers,” said Omar Khan, chief strategy officer for Samsung Mobile. “The 7-inch display and thin, lightweight design, combined with premium content and productivity tools makes the Galaxy Tab a true mobile tablet that is as comfortable to use standing on a crowded train as it is relaxing on the couch at home. The Galaxy Tab is perfect for watching a movie, reading an e-book or catching up with your favorite TV shows or chatting with an old friend. Plus, the Tab’s design makes it completely pocketable in your pants or jacket.”<br /><br />Powerful Display, Portable Design<br />The Galaxy Tab’s 7-inch display features enhanced TFT technology, offering brighter colors and clearer pictures, whether watching a movie or reading a book. The display delivers 1024 x 600 WSVGA resolution, offering full support to the Android 2.2 operating system. With support for Flash Player 10.1, the Galaxy Tab delivers an enhanced content experience when compared to other tablets currently available in the U.S. Users can engage with thousands of sites with rich Flash based applications and content including games, animations, rich Internet applications (RIAs), data presentations and visualizations, ecommerce, video, music and more. Samsung’s mobile tablet also provides access to the more than 80,000 applications currently available on the Android Market™.<br /><br />Many of the built-in productivity services and Android applications are scalable to fit the Galaxy Tab’s full 7-inch screen. For example, the user’s email, calendar and contacts will all rotate from portrait to landscape format through the tablet’s accelerometer and then open as a split-screen to create a PC or laptop viewing experience on the Tab. Likewise, many Android Market applications will open in full screen. Non-scalable Android Market applications will be framed and centered on the Galaxy Tab screen.<br /><br />The Samsung Galaxy Tab is designed for people who want a premium mobile entertainment experience on the go, but don’t want to be weighed down by a bulky device. The Galaxy Tab fits in a pocket or purse, weighs only 13 ounces and is 12 millimeters thin. Those super-light and sleek dimensions, matched with the 7-inch touchscreen display allows the Galaxy Tab to easily fit into a jeans’ backpocket or the inside pocket of a jacket. The compact design of Galaxy Tab also makes it easy for the user to type on the virtual keyboard with both thumbs or with one hand using Swype technology to type with one continuous finger motion across the keyboard.  <br /><br />Two Cameras, One-on-One Video Chat<br />The Galaxy Tab is designed with a rear-facing 3 megapixel camera for taking pictures on-the-go and sharing with family and friends. The Tab is also outfitted with a front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera and camcorder, enabling video chat with other people who have video conferencing capabilities. Users can align the Galaxy Tab with video chat clients including Qik and Fring and seamlessly talk with other people over a WiFi connection.<br /> <br />Google Mobile Services Benefits<br />Services like Google Maps™ Navigation (Beta) and Google Goggles are available on Google’s Android platform. With useful location-based services like Google Maps™, consumers can search in Standard English instead of entering an exact address. A search-by-voice function is just as intuitive, meaning searches can also be completed easily on the go. Google Goggles™ is a powerful, visual search tool that uses the Samsung GALAXY Tab’s camera to uncover information – an image of a landmark or artwork is automatically used to perform a search, delivering relevant content like a description or history. In addition, with a camera, users can enjoy various augmented reality services which are downloadable in the application market.<br /> <br />Samsung Social Hub Simplifies<br />Just like the Samsung Galaxy S smart phone portfolio, the Galaxy Tab keep users connected with Samsung’s Social Hub application. Social Hub works with the user’s Messaging and Contacts to initiate the sending and receiving of information, whether it is e-mail, instant messaging, social network updates or SMS messages. Additionally, calendar information from portal calendars, such as Google Calendar, and social networking services are displayed together in one calendar with two-way synchronization.<br /><br />Additional features of the Galaxy Tab include:<br />- Daily Briefing: Offers instant access to weather, news, stocks, and schedules.<br />- Impressive Onboard & Expandable Memory: Galaxy Tab can add 32 GB of external memory to store and manage your favorite video content and pictures.<br />- AllShare DLNA Technology: Take video or pictures shot with Galaxy Tab and send content wirelessly to other DLNA-enabled devices (HDTVs, laptops, PC monitors, etc.)<br />- Document Viewer & Editor: Open and make changes to any Word, Excel, Powerpoint or PDF document<br />- 4,000 mAh Battery: Super-sized battery provides ample power to watch movies, share content and surf the Web<br /><br />Samsung Media Hub – Entertaining the Masses<br />In addition, the Galaxy Tab will include future access to Media Hub, Samsung’s own content service, offering a vast lineup of critically acclaimed films and TV programs for rent or purchase. Samsung is working with the biggest and best names in entertainment, including MTV Networks, NBC, Universal Studios Home Entertainment and Paramount to assemble a full library of movies and TV programming, including new release films, next day TV  episodes and even full TV show seasons. Media Hub also allows the user to expand the entertainment experience, allowing content purchased to permanently own to be shared with up to five devices that carry the Media Hub application.<br /> <br />Premium Accessories Portfolio<br />To enhance the Galaxy Tab user experience even further, a set of accessories designed specifically for the mobile tablet are available for purchase from www.Samsung.com including:<br /><br />Keyboard Dock - $99.99<br />- Ergonomic, comfortable full-size keyboard with 7” Galaxy Tab replaceable inserts that doubles as a charger for power and synchronization of media and data <br />- Dock contains convenient stereo audio output jack for connecting to speakers or home stereo<br />Desktop Dock - $49.99<br />- Doubles as a Galaxy Tab charger using the Micro USB wall adapter that comes with the Tab; allows users to view movies, display as a digital picture frame and listen to music<br />- HDMI output to view HD content on HDTV enabled with 1080p resolution and provides HDTV connection to play content from the Galaxy Tab to a television <br />Car/GPS Dock - $99.99<br />- Conveniently positions 7” Galaxy Tab display screen inside car for turn-by-turn GPS navigation instructions and traffic updates<br />- Attachable to either the windshield or car dashboard and rotates freely between landscape and portrait modes<br /><br />Upcoming Availability<br />The Samsung Galaxy Tab portfolio of mobile tablets from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless will be available in the coming months.
