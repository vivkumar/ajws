Simple Java XML Parser - Library Dependencies
---------------------------------------------
	
* xpp3-1.1.4c.jar
	Required:		Any non-Android Java Platform (web service, web app, client, etc.)
	Not-Required: 	Android application

	This library provides the default implementation for the XML Pull Parsing 
	spec that SJXP will use. You need this library in your Classpath in all 
	cases *except* when deploying SJXP inside of an Android	application.
	
	The Android runtime already provides this dependency, so when deploying to
	Android you only need the sjxp JAR by itself as part of your app.
	
* junit-4.8.2.jar
	Required:	Optional 

	As expected, this library is only needed in the classpath at compile or
	runtime if you plan on working with or running the test cases in the
	/src/main/test folder.
	
	If you aren't working with the test cases, this JAR can be omitted from your
	deployment.
