To build any version here (default, ajws, sequential), simply go inside the directory and issue:
ant clean
ant

The ant will create jars (jmetal.jar, jmetal-seq.jar, jmetal-ws.jar)
There is an experiment.sh file in each directory to launch a simple experiment

In case of ajws version, the ajws-to-Java translation is done inside directory ajws/gen. 
To run the experiment.sh inside ajws, you need to build TryCatchWS runtime
